# nlp-project
Natural Language Processing Group Project / Fall 2020

`master` branch: Do not push directly to master, this is the final product. Merge `develop` into `master`.

`develop` branch: Code changes should begin on branches branching from here, then merge back into `develop`.

`exploration` branch: This branch has "throwaway" code exploration that is peripheral to the `develop` branch.
