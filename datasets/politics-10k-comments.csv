That said, there *were* sketchy cases of profitable companies that were paying zero in income tax that I found interesting reading that report.  They were just very rare (30 of the 500 companies surveyed). As the article noted:

&gt; Citizens for Tax Justice pointed the finger at the rules for accelerated depreciation and stock options. The report said these and various other deductions allowed the firms to avoid hefty tax bills. However, those policy matters fall outside the scope of this fact check.

I don't know that much on *this* particular topic and might have to do reading later.  I also recall hearing about companies that sell their patents to overseas subsidiary and then have their overseas subsidiary charge themselves hefty license fees, and as long as the money stays overseas they don't trigger US taxes on it, so it reduces their overall tax bill, but my understanding is that this technique is quite uncommon (Tim Cook actually mentioned this as an example of things Apple *didn't* do during a senate hearing).  Obviously, you can't do that with ALL of your money but it does reduce your tax bill significantly.


As a dual citizen, interestingly, I am *personally* subject to the same thing these companies are: i.e., if I take a job in another country (say, Italy) and make money, the US expects to tax me on it if their taxes are smaller than the US's.  Fortunately for me, however, there's a personal exemption (something like 90k or 100k) so it won't affect me unless I make a *lot* of money over there, and right now I work in the US.",,1430439675,0,t1_cqufl58

i grew up in a hunting family.  deer season put meat on our table for the better part of each year, with partridge, squirrel, and rabbit thrown in for good measure.  nobody in my dad's hunting party, which could be anywhere from 5 immediate family members to 30 friends and neighbors, would ever consider using an assault rifle to take down a deer.  it's overkill, no pun intended.  in the gun rack on the wall, my dad had an assortment of shotguns for birds and scoped rifles for larger game.

hell... my dad's best friend took down a black bear that was better than 7' long from tail to nose with a bow and arrow.  he gifted my parents with the pelt, which hung in the living room for several years.

realistically, the only reason to posess an assault rifle is if you are in the military and constantly engaged in combat where the entity you're shooting *is shooting back at you.*  show me a deer, or elk, or bear that can shoot back and you'll have an argument for civilian use of assualt weapons.

That’s why the President took action to fix as much of the broken system as he could through his immigration accountability executive actions. These actions will help secure the border, prioritize felons, not families, and hold undocumented immigrants accountable by requiring them to pass a criminal background check and pay their fair share of taxes, and modernizes the legal immigration system. These are common-sense steps, but only Congress can finish the job.

Three critical elements of the President's executive actions are:

    Cracking Down on Illegal Immigration at the Border: The President’s actions increase the chances that anyone attempting to cross the border illegally will be caught and sent back. Continuing the surge of resources that effectively reduced the number of unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally this summer, the President’s actions will also centralize border security command-and-control to continue to crack down on illegal immigration.
    Deporting Felons, Not Families: The President’s actions focus on the deportation of people who threaten national security and public safety. He has directed immigration enforcement to place anyone suspected of terrorism, violent criminals, gang members, and recent border crossers at the top of the deportation priority list.
    Accountability – Criminal Background Checks and Taxes: The President is also acting to hold accountable those undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for more than five years and are parents of U.S. citizens or Lawful Permanent Residents. By registering and passing criminal and national security background checks, millions of undocumented immigrants will start paying their fair share of taxes and temporarily stay in the U.S. without fear of deportation for three years at a time.

The President’s actions will also streamline legal immigration to boost our economy and will promote naturalization for those who qualify.""

So, yeah, he's working on it, after giving Congress lots of room to do it themselves.  Now Congress is demanding Obama stop working on it, which you should also feel free to complain about - oh, you already did.

Detroiter here. ""White flight"" was just people fleeing to the suburbs after the race riots. They were 20 minutes away. The auto companies weren't shutting down factories because some managers needed to drive 20 extra minutes to the office.

They were shutting down because of 2 things:

1) Bad management decisions that happened to line up in an unfortunate manner with gas price spikes(going big on SUVs in the early 2000s)

2) An absolutely *insane* cost per-line worker for unskilled labor, $70-120 per hour depending on who you ask.

3) There were a lot better places to run factories, often just a few states over.

4) Pension funds(once again, for no-skill laborers) that added up to around $100 billion in liabilities.

Detroit is absolutely fucked, and while a lot of the responsibility lies with management, a lot of it also lies with UAW for usi ng *every ounce of power they had* for whatever they wanted, well past the point where their labor was producing equivalent value.",,0,0,t1_cqufetn

Vote count was Clinton 44.9 million Bush 39.1 million Perot 19.7 million. Never mind Hillary without a third party we would have never even had a Bill Clinton Presidency. ",,0,0,t1_cqufe4v

Take the baker example.

""I don't bake wedding cakes for anyone"" - appropriate.
""I don't bake wedding cakes for &lt;%insert group du jour, in this case gay couples%&gt; - inappropriate.

Now, if said baker wanted to scream about 1st amendment rights, that opens up another can of worms as it would have to proven that baking a cake restricts your ability to practice your religion. For that you would have to prove that a baker baking cakes is a religious activity, and that a wedding cake is a religious symbol.... good luck with that. 

Even if you miraculously prove the view that a wedding cake is a religious symbol and that baking a wedding cake is a religious practice, then you fall foul of the protected class statute as that would then mean that unless you baked wedding cakes for every religion, which may include religions that support gay marriage, then you would be discriminating based on religion.

tldr; The fundamental issue here is that LGBT individuals are not covered by federally protected class status, which they should be.

Winters seem harsh recently but are well within longer term norms (100 years).  So, in the US you basically have the Southwestern drought and that's it.  Doesn't seem like an increase in extreme events to me.  The presence of one extreme event is not an increase, I would argue it would be notable if there were no extreme events.

I am purposefully restricting this to the US, 1) I live here and thus I have some knowledge of the historical weather and 2) Given the size of the US (third largest by land area in the world) would be kinda tough for there to be more extreme events going on and not see them in the US.",,0,0,t1_cqugosk

And just for the record, the Foundation isn't legally required to list a single donor if they don't want to.  They hire the best accounting firms, then hire an auditor to check them, then publish it all online for anyone who wants to see.  Most of their tax forms  are over 25 pages.  Re-filing tax statements on a Foundation that deals in hundreds of millions of dollars is not really unusual at all.

All you actually need to do is PROVE they've done something illegal and we can end this right here --- you win.  In the meantime all you have is your right wing talking points and innuendos.

It definitely has to do with disenfranchisement, but not in respect to childcare. That's Bernie pushing his agenda onto to protests in Baltimore. I'm surprised he didn't use the opportunity to talk about the war on drugs or something that actually is related to the unfair criminal justice system.

Bernie Sanders' greatest appeal is what he talked about about halfway through. He admits that he isn't going to raise as much money as Hillary Clinton, he says most of his money is going to come from people giving him $50 rather than $50,000. That's going to go over really well with people. Most people hate all this money in politics. They like a guy who isn't getting corporate money, who is financed by everyday people giving him a few dollars here and there. That's really appealing. He should focus on that.

I think he's wrong on Glass-Steagall. Reinstating it would not fix the financial system, but it's not what broke it. The banks that failed weren't effect by that repeal. They hadn't merged under the new rules. He didn't mentioned his idea for a financial transactions tax in this interview, but that's potential the worst idea that has ever come from a Presidential candidate. If you read Paul Krugman's analysis of the 2008 financial crisis, he attributes much of the damage to the shadow banking system, which is essentially unregulated. If you impose fees on financial institutions, they will conduct more activity in the shadow banking system. What else do you expect to happen? If they have to pay a fee on their risky transactions, they'll just do it in the shadows, with no regulation, no oversight.",,0,0,t3_34gje1

There were other checks and balances as well (differing term lengths and how often they came up for election), but I think the purpose of the Senate is to prevent the more populous States from overriding the interests of the less populous States.

&gt; American labor is costlier but it is also more productive making it actually cheaper to manufacture goods in the US than in Vietnam.

Exactly. The idea that American labor is costlier ignores our competitive advantage  in certain fields and our ability to scale and redistribute work through automation.

What I agree with Sanders on is that we should not have ever funded off-shoring, that the Bush administration should not have seen off-shoring as an ""industry"" that Welsh was wrong, that a lot of off-shoring adventures were oversold, and that we the taxpayer actually had to pay for it. 


Those are where what Bernie says makes the most sense. Given what the Bush administration did in 2003 with tax holidays and in 2001 forward with the WTO it is natural to be suspicious of trade agreements and to support the idea that what they do be done in public conventions.

Labor unions serve several roles.  They may be protectionist, but they also have provided healthy dialog on important issues.  While the AFL-CIO may be protectionist in many ways, it was the UAW who was the only party talking sense during the auto bankruptcy crisis in 2008.  Plus, there is little or no protectionism involved in teachers unions: wanting better teacher/student ratios promotes better education - again an area where unions talk sense and people like Scott Walker talk through their hat.",,1430443371,0,t1_cquiqc2

Second, we've actually studied this both abroad and here in the US. We looked at work reductions specifically and found that no one stopped working. The work reductions found were slight, depended on factors like the amount of the income given and whether the person was a primary earner, a secondary earner, a parent, or a student.

Primary earners spent more time between jobs looking for presumably better jobs. Secondary earners saw larger reductions but still slight, new mothers took longer maternity leaves, and students chose school over work.

Possibly most interesting of all are the results to be found in places like Namibia and Liberia where in the former, self-employed increased 301%, and in the latter, one third of those receiving the income started their own businesses.

Now, people see stuff like this and think those countries are totally different, and they are, but people really aren't. So many of us want to be our own bosses. Try it sometime.

Regarding your last thought, I'd love to believe it were possible, but it's very unlikely. Governments rule with laws, usually there are laws against treason to protect the ruling individuals from possible revolt, these laws individually suppress those people wanting change until there are more people wanting change than can be suppressed; this is when judicial law is tossed and martial law is enacted, further suppressing the dissenters. Peaceful revolution requires cooperation between those ruling and the citizens, and far too often those ruling have too much to lose to give it up willingly, which is what forces the citizenship to use other means.",,0,0,t1_cquhzol

Second being before any  third party candidate can gain any traction people in the party he will be extracting votes from get in an uproar.  It's understandable, it's predictable and it's a major reason why there has not been a third party candidate since Ross Perot.

NEWS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:           
October 3, 1988

LEAGUE REFUSES TO ""HELP PERPETRATE A FRAUD""

WITHDRAWS SUPPORT FROM FINAL PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

WASHINGTON, DC —""The League of Women Voters is withdrawing its sponsorship of the presidential debate scheduled for mid-October because the demands of the two campaign organizations would perpetrate a fraud on the American voter,"" League President Nancy M. Neuman said today.

""It has become clear to us that the candidates' organizations aim to add debates to their list of campaign-trail charades devoid of substance, spontaneity and honest answers to tough questions,"" Neuman said. ""The League has no intention of becoming an accessory to the hoodwinking of the American public.""

So the repubs and dems did this.....

The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) is a private firm. It began in 1987 by the Democratic and Republican parties to establish the way that presidential election debates are run between candidates for President of the United States. The Commission is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation as defined by federal US tax laws,[1] whose debates are sponsored by private contributions from foundations and corporations.[2]

Both her and her husband are ""self made"", which means they started off in the middle class.

They understand the plight of the middle class and have both spend their careers addressing the issue. You have literally no evidence about anything to the contrary it's just guesswork because she's been in Washington forever and it's a talking point of the radical left.

This is the most absurd statement ever. She's certainly more moderate than Sanders, but has done QUITE a bit to help the liberal agenda during her tenure. Her stance on economic issues has been fairly consistent throughout her career and she's been an advocate of the middle class since she was First Lady WAY WAY WAY back when.

Most people do not have to worry about estate taxes, but if you do and you and your partner are not married, you won’t be able to use many of the tricks that married couples can use to avoid these taxes.  

The Federal Estate Tax Exemption Is Very High  
Only estates worth more than $5.25 million will pay federal estate tax in 2013. So, if you die in 2013, and you leave taxable assets worth less than $5.25 million, you don’t need to worry about federal estate tax. And all assets left to a surviving spouse -- including a validly married spouse of the same sex -- are exempt from federal estate tax.""

Right now the states DO have almost all of the power. States didn't have to implement common core or any other system for that matter, they give their own tests, hire their own staff, superintendents, and admins, set athletic rules and schedules, allocate funds in their own way, the vast majority of education funds are from state income and local property taxes. They determine voucher allocation and programs, and allocate funds to public colleges. I don't even think the average american could tell you what the department of education even does other than setting a couple of minimum requirement standards. The allocation of funds through differing local property tax revenues is a huge reason for poor districts getting almost no money. A smaller bit is the whole southern states teaching creationism thing, but that's not nearly my biggest issue with it.

Fuck yes.

Not everyone in the South has a freedom boner for the Republicans OR Democrats.  Most of the state will vote red, true, but there are people who are sick of the big bank bullshit.  

I myself would never consider abortion, was taught gay marriage is wrong, and love guns.  Color me red, white, and blue, and let the eagles fly right?

Wrong.  I don't believe my personal opinions are right for the country.  I don't believe the Right is aiming for what the country needs.  

Religious beliefs, which are mainly what cause the gay marriage hate, should not apply for a country that isn't one religion.  You wouldn't expect an Islamic, Daoist, Jewish, Rastafarian, Pastafarian, or any other religious person to push their views on your country would you?  And don't feed me the ""founded on Christianity"" shit.  Having slaves doesn't seem very Christian.  Read Philemon and about Onesimus, and see if Paul thought slaves were cool.  Spoiler: No.  
So, in short, there are a lot of people who are against Red, and will pull for Bernie.  Not because of his Democrat affiliation, not because of his gender, or race.  But because of what he stands for, and the kind of man he is.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure that is as true as you think it is, as petty as that sounds.

[If you wonder if that's true, then you need look no further than the amendment to Alabama's state constitution banning gay marriage:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Amendment_774)

(f) The State of Alabama shall not recognize as valid any common law marriage of parties of the same sex.
(g) A union replicating marriage of or between persons of the same sex in the State of Alabama or in any other jurisdiction shall be considered and treated in all respects as having no legal force or effect in this state and shall not be recognized by this state as a marriage or other union replicating marriage.

Nearly every state that banned gay marriages also banned gay civil unions or gay anythings that gave any of the same rights as marriage.

Civil marriage is already totally removed from religious marriage.  You can get a civil married even if you have never stepped foot inside a church in your entire life.  Likewise, if you can convince them to do it, you can get a preacher to give you a completely religious marriage which is not recognized by the civil government.

You seem to be mistakenly thinking that the marriage license you got at the courthouse is not valid unless it's signed by a preacher.

There's also another problem with renaming marriages to civil unions: you'd have to do it in each and every state and the federal government to pull it off.  Otherwise your ""civil union"" in one state might not be recognized in another that only gives weight to ""marriage"".  That is actually the case now with the federal government.  Gay civil unions don't count, gay marriages do.",,0,0,t1_cqu3rbg

&gt;I'm not saying you should jump on the Clinton bandwagon, but you really shouldn't be spending your time attacking her. That's a stupid thing to do in the primary.

The primary season IS the time to thoroughly vet the candidates. In the last primary one things that convinced me to vote for Obama over all other candidates was his and his campaign's ability to answer the ""attacks"" with clear and well-thought-out  answers and how well they were able to defeat the Rove dirty tricks machine.  Hillary lost the last primary election despite everyone saying she would be the Dem candidate. And when Obama won it excited the base as much as Kerry killed it. 

My fear is that a Hillary campaign would be just like the last Kerry campaign. Same old tired group, running the same old tired positions, falling to the ""flip-flopping"" attacks from the GOP, failing to excite the ground-troops, bringing every libral-hatin-thumper out of the woodwork to fight for the GOP, and eventually losing to the most unpopular president since Hoover.

&gt; 

Not sure where you got this from. The reverse scenario is completely possible. The man could choose a wife who doesn't help out around the house.

I know a guy who is having that exact problem. His wife is in a low earning job with no desire to improve and when she gets home, just sits in front of the TV all night. He ends up doing most of the housework and earning the money. If he were to divorce her for this, she would not be held accountable for this. He would still owe her money.

&gt;Again, in this same scenario, marriage is infinitely better than cohabiting. Now the jerk who doesn't help out, may owe her spousal support for career damage from her having to care for sick kids, being unavailable for overtime etc.

The issue is none of that depends on him being a jerk. She can get all that if she gets bored of marriage, or wants her husband to do all the housework. It just gives the lower earning spouse leverage.

This also doesn't address why the higher earning partner should get married. ""Honey, I want to marry so that if I am unhappy with the relationship, I can get court ordered alimony payments from you."" is not a good sales pitch. This is a big part of why so many couples are just living together while married.",,1430445829,0,t1_cquh65n

That's the problem with Clinton. She plays it safe and only says things that are safe to say. Her voting record in Senate was bland. She doesn't make waves. She won't fight for an issue, and sticks to feel-good rhetoric. About the most aggressive she's got is her opinions on tax reform which are about the exact same as pretty much anyone in the democratic party.

I'll give her credit in the one area that her opinions are potentially different from current democratic policy: her ideas on education reform protecting the right of teachers to collective bargaining are good. Opposing standardized testing is great. But that's about all I can give her, and if I were American I  could  not possibly vote for someone so pandering with such  poor precedent in her voting record. The American public  screwed up with Obama.  They believed him despite a bland voting record. They can't just  take  Hillary's word. They have to examine her past actions,  and they speak for themselves.

In contrast to that, look at Bernie's voting record. Look at the bills he's been a co-sponsor on. https://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/27110/bernie-sanders#.VULg1CGqpBc This is a guy who right or wrong votes only his consciousness and does right  by the people he's representing. He's a guy that is more and more popular in his home state that despite running as an independent has virtually always won by large margins. He doesn't play politics, he deals in facts, and with his consciousness.

No, raising the minimum wage is not all he has. The man wants to rebuild our infrastructure. He wants to actually fund our public schools and stop depriving schools of their budgets.

See, herein lies the problem. Everyone repeating this crap. You get into a mindset of he can't win so we can't support him.

If he can beat Hillary he can wipe the floor with Jeb Bush. You can vote for him in the primaries without it being a spoiler. You can work hard to help him win the primary. If he can win the primary he can win the GE.

The other day someone linked a study that showed doubling the budget of a campaign only affects 1% of voters. So if he can only get together 1/4 the budget of Jeb or Hillary he needs to get over a 2% disadvantage. With his debating skills, his conscientious voting record and lack of stains in his past I absolutely believe he can do this.

The only way to break out of the chicken and egg problem is to force him in. Precedent will then make people more  willing to support other ""underdogs"" that they feel are ""the right person"" but that ""don't have a chance"".

Its the fight between Bernie and Generic Republican that you should be worried about.

EDIT: I mean if you want an example, today on NPR (On Point) they interviewed the author of the book about shady dealings while Hillary was Sec. of State. Hillary's people backed out of the interview. They are already struggling to address this stuff. No other candidate is going to let them sweep it under the rug, that's just simple truth. If Hillary is going to lose this, she's going to lose it because she's simply a weak candidate that has name recognition.",,1430447771,0,t1_cquib8d

The Scotch-Irish spent about a hundred years in Ulster (at war, more or less, with the local Catholics the whole time) before large numbers of them began to immigrate to the American South around 1710 (because of drought, land ownership disputes and other problems).

In simple terms, the Scotch-Irish were badasses.  They started out as troublemakers on the Scottish-English border (the ""Border Reivers""), then were relocated to Ireland to break Catholic heads, and then ended up in Appalachia fighting the native Americans.  

Originally they were mostly Presbyterians, but over time they became Baptists and Methodists - two sects that are key to modern American evangelism.  

Anyway, to summarize, the American South - the Evangelical's homeland - was originally settled by a group who originated as a sort of anti-Catholic shock troops in Ulster In the 17th century.  EDIT: So... the people who evolved into modern Evangelicals have been hating Catholics since before there was a U.S. and since long before the modern Evangelical movement even began.",,1430451933,0,t1_cqtz67s

Regardless, the point is that Bush's grandfather, Prescott Bush, contacted a popular ex-general, Smedley Butler, to lead a coup against Roosevelt.  Fortunately, Butler was a real hero and tried to out Prescott's plan to congress.

We had just been attacked and were told these were the people who attacked us (Afghanstan), then we were told that their neighbor had biological weapons and was going to use them on us. Hindsight bias is a real thing and I think you're falling victim to it.

It's clear that basically no one would have gone down the same path if we all had all the information, but supporting the war in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 doesn't seem unreasonable. 

------------

Hillary may be more prone to the cliche ""American Imperialism"" mentality (as her proposed Syrian arming of the Rebels might indicate), but that doesn't make her a bad choice. She's NOT the person who's ready to attack Iran on a whim when we have a real chance for peace. From what I can tell, Sanders would like to return the U.S. to a 1930's isolationism-esqu country. 

Hillary certainly is different in this regard. However, I honestly don't think that position is realistic in the current world. Our current ""status quo"" helps the US at large in many areas and it's not a bad idea. There's a reason that literally every president from FDR onward has continued to expand the US influence in the world, it's a good thing for us.

-You will have entire generations using the basic income as a crutch and never actually making a real living, keeping them dependent on the government.  Once basic income starts, it will also be difficult to end (even if the country runs out of money), because so many people will be completely dependent on it.
-Taxes will increase significantly..and keep increasing.  This will cause inflation because the new minimum wage will now need to exceed basic income, eating away at the middle class and above.  Combined with the increasing taxes required every year, it will mean less and less money for everyone not taking basic income, commonly known as ""wealth distribution"".  Australia is a good example of this: minimum wage is ~$20/hour, but even a combo meal at Burger king is double or triple the price...making that minimum wage not so attractive anymore.
-Businesses will be much more difficult to start.  Pretty much the only way to stop being a wage slave is to start your own business.

What illegal immigration is about is usually *overstaying* one's visa. You arrive legally, from a country like Ireland (because you can visit and stay for 90 days for basically any purpose *other than working*), and what do you know, your return flight arrangements don't work out, and 91 days after you arrive, you are hanging out, and you get by working as a waitress, where you get paid in cash.

In this example, the law isn't being broken by *being in the U.S.* because there is no law against anyone in particular being in the U.S., it is that you violated the *terms of your visa*, and you *took a job which you were not legally allowed to take.* You don't have the right documents for your job. That makes you an *undocumented worker*. 

As for birthright citizenship, almost everyone who is now a U.S. citizen got it from being born in the U.S., either directly, or because immigration was much more lightly controlled up to the 1920s (for Europeans, at least), and the children of those immigrants were born in the U.S.

Very few people trace their U.S. citizenship back to citizenship acquired at the time of the founding of the U.S.A. *That* is the alternative to birthright citizenship. (And many black ancestors *were* in the U.S. at the founding, but not as citizens).

Obama is a Democrat.  Democrats caused the financial crisis.


Mind you, I don't believe this for a second, but Tea Party folks like Cruz and his supporters absolutely believe this.  The reasoning goes like this...

The economy was doing just fine until the Democrats took over Congress in January of 2007.  Within just a few months, the whole shebang began to unravel.

When you point out that there's literally no way the Democratic controlled Congress could have tanked the economy in less than one year, they'll fall back to their next position:

When Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, it was Barney Frank and a few other Democrats who passed legislation that led to the economic crisis.  


If you are so bold to point out that they could only do so with the compliance of the GOP and George W. Bush, they'll fall back on the next position:

The housing crisis was caused by Jimmy Carter with the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act.


Never mind that there were 12 years of Republicans in the White House afterwards.  No, those Democrats over there are the reason your house isn't worth anything and your retirement accounts suck!  I saw 'em do it!  And that Barack Obama is a Democrat too!

Roommates and marriages are *nothing* alike! Not going to bother checking off how; it should be obvious.

&gt;In the end its an individual's responsibility to protect their financial security.

Why would anyone want to get married if they're individuals first? Do you think everyone would create loophole-free contracts? Do think everyone would be completely honest about their assets or update their contracts to reflect familial/financial changes? Many would, but enough people would ""just in case"" the shit out of that thing in the beginning and never touch it again. A lot of people get screwed over and then marriage has a stigma. Fewer and fewer men have confidence in the idea of marriage with today's divorce laws heavily favoring women. Personal contracts would do the same thing after enough stories made headlines.

The state gets involved because marriage is good for economies, societies, and people. Things are better for everyone if people are settling down, raising families, and building communities. There are plenty examples in the world of what happens with broken families, unsupervised children, and no sense of community. So, of course the state wants in; makes their job easier and more lucrative.

I mostly agree with the idea of what you're saying, but I think you're giving those ideas far too much credit for how they would play out in practice. Don't get me wrong: I think 50/50 splits are seldom right or justified, but I also think a certain level of support (never for a lifetime) is reasonable in many cases.

I don't buy arguments that the Democrats were destined to lose control of Congress.  Past historical trends were not a reliable harbinger of what was to come because Republicans screwed up the country royally in 2008.  Had Democrats hammered Republicans over their massive political and economic failures following 2008 instead of playing political footsy with them, they could have garnered the very same Congressional majority that Democrats enjoyed for years after Republicans created the Great Depression.  They can still do that, but they have to take the political gloves off and give Republicans the Hell they earned.

How am I supposed to believe a Woman who takes ""contributions"" to help foreign policies.  Her and her husband combined have a net worth of close to $100,000,000 (one hundred million).  [Does she truly believe that anyone is going to take her seriously when she says that America needs to do something to topple the richest 1%.](http://www.sott.net/article/295524-Hot-air-Hillary-Clinton-called-for-toppling-the-wealthiest-1)

I'm not saying Bill was a saint, he certainly was not, but he was I think, overall more likable than Hillary.

No it really is.  I am 35 years old and guess what, I have never voted before, I just registered to vote for Sanders.

People don't vote because they don't believe in what they are voting for, just because you have perceived options, doesn't mean you have actual options.

People are literally coming out of the woodwork asking how they register to vote.  There are 16 year old kids who want to know how they can help Sanders since they can't vote yet.  There are people who are quite literally changing their party affiliation in closed-primary states to Democratic JUST to vote for Sanders.

This may have something to do with the fact that Bernie is not in fact a Democrat.  Oh, he's certainly progressive, but he's run **from** the party that he's now seeking to nominate him for President.


Now I realize that this sub has become for all intents and purposes the ""Run, Bernie, Run!"" cheer squad, but perhaps one of the devoted true believers can take time out of upvoting every ""Bernie Sanders is Awesome"" post to explain exactly how he can possibly win the nomination of a party that he's rejected, and that really doesn't want him as anything other than a foil for an actual Democrat?

I lived in Taiwan for 5 years.  Single-payer doesn't work ""well"" in Taiwan.  Yes, you can just go into the hospital whenever you want, but for anything but major surgery, you don't get very much help and the doctors want to push you out the door as fast as they get you in there.

Major surgery means getting on a long wait-list, unless you opt for the more expensive private care.

I think the major problem with single-payer is that it creates a mindset that you can just go in there whenever you want.  People actually paying their taxes will go in for every little thing (after all, they paid for it..right?) and poor people that don't pay anything toward the system will also flood hospitals for whatever they need.

It's not a very efficient system and leads to poorer service, long wait-lists for major surgery (I think the only reason Canada can have this type of system is because many people can just drive over the border to get surgeries when they don't want to wait 2+ years), and sub-par equipment because of the money constraints involved.

Yes, there are problems with our current system, but single-payer isn't the panacea.",,0,0,t3_34fxvj

Just because the rest of some states are red as fuck due to the rural populations doesn't mean the real moneymakers are conservative.

you cant compare the average joe that is opening a coffee shop or  a business  in the living room of his house with Walmart.    Walmart had resources to pay, am average joe dont.

Besides increase wages without increase productivity or labour hours  only create inflation. Yes the people will spend more in short time but in the long time  that will make the demand of products and service increase too and the business will have to rise the prices so the can invest more to produce more.   

In latinamerica,  Peru in the 80's and Venezuela since the socialist goverment established the minimum wage according to the necesities of the workers. Both countries ended up with  hiperinflation,  being unrealistic minimun wage as one of the cause.    

In Venezuela the economist calculated for every 1% that minimun wage is increase all the price of products and services increase 1,5% in a period of two months.

So while you can absolutely make a comparison to the political leanings of other developed democracies, the concluding point should be where Sanders falls on the US spectrum.

He is running for President in the US and therefore how he would be perceived by the European electorate doesn't really matter here. It'd be the same as saying that all French politicians are radically Left when compared to the US. Is it true? Sure, but the US doesn't elect French politicians so the discussion itself is limiting in necessity.

&gt;That resentment will do absolutely nothing to end discrimination, in fact it will breed hate.

As I said to you elsewhere, everything you're saying was said about racial integration (accomplished only at the point of the National Guard's rifle).

In fact people still like to make that dumb argument, as they continue to claim that integration and the Civil Rights Act actually *hurt* Blacks, or did nothing, or made the racists more hardline, resentful, etc.

But as with racial segregation, old people will bitch about it, steadily dying off, while the younger generation won't give one rat's ass.

Even younger EVANGELICALS have accepted gay marriage, and their elders are all in a panic.

http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/mayweb-only/evangelicals-shift-same-sex-marriage.html

Of course some intolerant people will linger forever, blaming their intolerance on laws trying to 'force' or 'brainwash' them.  But they'll seem as foolish as the dipshits over at the racists subs on reddit.

As far as you last question - that's not my theory - but to be clear, first amendment rights aren't trump cards.  They are IN ALL CASES, balanced against the state's interest.

E.g., you don't have an absolute right to speak anytime, anywhere - the government has an interest in social order and can limit the time and place.  

In the case of a Church, the Court has afforded their religious interest a greater weight because it's a religious institution.  But it's ALWAYS a balancing act - e.g., the Bob Jones University/Church lost its nonprofit status because it forbade interracial dating.

Did you get that? The government's interest in preventing discrimination OVERRODE the Church's religious dogma.  This is not new.

Similarly, the government can forbid racial segregation in privately-owned public accommodations (like restaurants, bakeries) to further the 14th Amendment, which you may recall is ALSO in the Constitution.

And quite soon the Supreme Court will announce that the government can do so to protect the 14th Amendment's (and Equal Protection Clause's) individual rights for gays and lesbians.

For starters, an assault rifle is by definition capable of firing more than one bullet with one trigger pull, so none of the guns we are discussing in the ""assault weapon"" category are ""assault rifles"". Assault rifles were banned for new civilian manufacture and sale in 1986.

""Assault weapons"" which are the target of these bans are semi automatic and can be chambered in a variety of calibers, anywhere from .22LR to .50 BMG, with plenty of great hunting calibers in between. Deer is one thing, and in fact in many states you can't use .223 for deer because it is consider too small and weak for a humane kill. Many people say you can make a clean kill with .223 and it is legal in many states, but there are plenty of other caliber choices, and you definitely don't need more than any couple of rounds for deer hunting. But if you think an AR15 in .223 is ""overkill"" for a deer you are funny. If anything it is ""underkill"".

I'm talking about wild boar which are dangerous and overpopulated in many areas of the US. For those you want a large magazine and the ability to fire rapidly, because they roam in packs and can gore hunters.  Coyotes are another example.

And no one needs your permission to own a gun, nor do they have to explain to you why they ""need"" it. You don't get to pick what kind of guns people use for sport, hunting, or self defense. An AR15 is no different from a ruger mini 14 ranch rifle, great for protecting your ranch.",,0,0,t1_cqugtaw

Your insurance company, that now has to cover your spouse because they're family?  They didn't sign that contract in your lawyers office, so without some law that requires it, they won't put them on your plan.

Some hospital that you just got admitted to?  They didn't sign it either, so to them, your spouses family is next of kin, not you.  Hope there's no bad blood.

The IRS?  Well, if the government doesn't recognize your marriage (and they won't because, hey, they're out of the marriage business completely aren't they) then there's no way you can file jointly.

As a result, Americans vote based on a candidate's likability and their own political identity, and very few mid-western soccer moms and Wal-Mart shelf-stockers are going to identify with a cranky 75-year-old northeastern socialist. 

Sanders biggest obstacle is that only 24% of Americans even identify as ""liberals"" at this point, and only a sliver of them see themselves as liberal as Sanders. (By comparison, 38% of Americans identify as ""conservative"" and 34% see themselves as ""moderate."") For Sanders to win, he'll have to pull off a monumental shift in American identity politics, convincing a large number of moderates that they've actually been socialists all along.

It's not impossible, but there's no precedent for it in American presidential election history. Outside of a major economic collapse or an impending world war, I don't see how any politician could shift those numbers so quickly.",,0,0,t1_cqtxu1z

Introducing these goods into the market at the low prices they are able to give them at reduces the overall market share, which reduces the profits of small businesses.  These small businesses then have to cut costs to compete, often leading to workers being laid off or quality being reduced, which leads to even less profit.  This cycle continues until the small business is forced to close.  That's because a small business who employs local workers can't compete with a company that uses slave labor to produce its goods.  Even in the food market, like that pizzeria, they wouldn't be able to continue to compete with multinational pizza companies who can use their vast wealth to create extremely cost effective supply chains (often using low quality materials filled with preservatives).  As worker wages stagnate (they have stagnated compared to inflation since the 1970s in the United States) people have less purchasing power.  Without the ability to buy quality goods, people have to resort to buying cheaper goods (Walmart and McDonalds).  

So the real solution would be either ending globalization or creating legislation that forces large companies who outsource labor to pay wages cometetive with those of U.S. workers.  This would drive up the price of low quality goods, which pretty much eliminate these multinational companies out of the market (because they would no longer be able to push cheap or defective products onto U.S. consumers).  But as that isn't going to happen, the only solution left is to either raise the minimum wage to a point where workers in the U.S. can afford living without being subsidized or eliminating the minimum wage entirely and allowing for regional wages to be set by demand instead of simply allowing companies to pay workers too little legally.",,0,0,t1_cqunr2j

The caucus is held in a large meeting space. Once you sign in, all of the voters are separated into precincts - at mine, it was one precinct per table. We talked about the strengths of each candidate and ultimately held a vote as a fair way to choose the candidate that we wanted to advance. Then we talked about delegates. The delegates are the people who represent our precinct at the county, state, and eventually national conventions. We chose one and two alternates, and then we were done! We turned in our selection to the registration table. I'm not sure what happens with them after that, but delegates attend County and State conventions where more voting for platforms and candidates happens. 

Turnout for these events is super low, and there were only 8 people at my table and only two of us were under 60. Some precincts only had one or two people show up. If that happens, you get to choose the candidate yourself and automatically get to be a delegate. 

The delegates are expected to vote for the candidate that the precints agreed to, but theoretically they could do whatever they wanted. I was out of town and didn't attend the county convention so I didn't get to go further, but I hope I can make it all the way this cycle. ",,0,0,t1_cqtqs6a

In most cases Parents (adults) make healthcare decisions for their children (under 18). Once you are turn 18 you can make your own healthcare choices. This includes but is not limited to treatments, exams, which doctors/groups to visit, and last but not least who can see them in the hospital. HIPAA dictates that a person's health history is a private affair and can only be disclosed to those that the Patient deems appropriate. If a person of sound mind is in the hospital and doesn't want their  mom/dad/brother/sister/wife/lover/friend/boss/etc.. to see them in the hospital, said hospital staff is required by law to prevent these people from gaining access to the patient. (if the hospital does allow unwanted visitors to see the patient the hospital could be in for a large lawsuit) In 90% of cases Patients are able to make their own decisions when it comes to who they want to see in the hospital, but their are cases when a patient is unable to make their own healthcare decisions, most of which revolve around some type of decreased mental capability. ie medically induced coma, decreased mental function from head trauma or stroke, mental disorders such as schizophrenia where legal rights have been removed from the patient, brain death, etc.. If a person in the hospital cant make their own healthcare decisions then the hospital has to fall back on a  predetermined hierarchy. Best case for the patient is when they have a legal document call a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare (DPOA) or living will. A DPOA tells the hospital staff who they can legally speak with when a healthcare choice needs to be made. This includes who can visit the patient. If you don't have a DPOA the hierarchy normally goes as follows: spouse, then adult children, then parents, then siblings, then grandparents, then grand kids.  A large problem you see in the hospital all the time is poor family dynamics, for example: lets say I am gay and i have been disowned by my family. I have lived with my gay partner for 15 years and have a great life with them, but I am not allowed to get married in the state in which I live. I am 40 years old and think I have a ton of time to make a will and a DPOA (only like 33% of adults have either) I break my leg in an car crash and have to go to the hospital. I don't like my family so I tell the staff not to let them visit me and the only person who can see me is my life partner. I end up needing surgery on my leg and have to be intubated, but i develop a complication called pneumonia (lung infection) and turn septic (blood infection) because I aspirated (gastric contents enter my lungs) and have poor lung function do to a history of smoking. The hospital has to place me on a ventilator in an induced coma to allow my lungs to heal. I am now no longer capable of informing the hospital staff of my healthcare wishes. The hospital legally has to have someone to make decisions for me. Therefore the hierarchy is instituted and my estranged parents now have the ability to tell the hospital what to do in terms of my care, which includes who can see me, and if they don't like my life partner they can bar him from entering. This is why someone needs rights to visit someone else in the hospital.",,0,0,t1_cqueqvs

They are about equal for both persons. I fully expect more individual donations for Hillary, because she is more popular, and those people stand to benefit from her winning. Bernie is less well known, less popular, and the blue collar people donating have less money to 'throw away' per se than the white collar donors Hillary has. But in PAC donations they are more equal. So it's just a question of who you think has more to gain, and who, in doing so, will cause the last harm to you.

They aren't changing how marriages are recognized. If you get a license and get married in another state, you still get the same benefits at federal and state level in Alabama. All they're doing is ceasing to issue marriage licenses in Alabama.

There's full length, proper articles that cover this issue. [Here's one](http://www.timesdaily.com/news/local/bill-to-eliminate-marriage-licenses-increase-fees-advances/article_5c146f65-aea7-5e42-9b8a-7a3eca9aaa4c.html)

&gt;Instead, marriages would be a legal contract, witnessed by a clergy member, attorney or notary public, and filed with the state through the probate office.

So nothing really changes except you don't have to go to th. This is just the Alabama court system washing their hands of the ordeal so they don't have to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. But people will still need to file with the state after they get married, marriage will still be a civil contract that requires divorce, lawyers, and judges to dissolve.

Also, FDR wasn't libertarian at all. You wanna give me some examples of how he sought to increase liberty?

That's a powerful argument to make while I've got looting and rioting going on 20 miles from my location. There are even reports of looters targeting certain ethnically-owned business. Which, if true, is even more evidence we don't live in a post-racist society.

Yea, I think there might be a misunderstanding. I'm not actually against gay marriage, or anything that happens between consenting adults, or any of that. My biggest objection to gay marriage, or any marriage is the need to seek out the government's permission in the first place. Though I might be swayed that *recording* the fact that marriage occurred *might* be a government function.

As far as I can tell, we were free of government oversight of marriage from the point we broke away from the Church of England to shortly after the Civil War. We only started then because someone thought it was the governments job to keep the racists from intermarrying or having plural weddings.

Especially when the alternative, given countries like Norway and Sweden, are inferior systems. 

I also think universal healthcare, a la singlepayer, would be an inferior system to an employer based healthcare regime with medicaid covering those unemployed... so basically Obamacare.  Tax-funded healthcare wields an inherent dead-weight loss, whereas employer mandated insurance side-steps this drag and yields a more efficient outcome for the individual and the economy at-large.  [Here's an article which describes this in greater detail.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/08/05/how-employer-based-health-insurance-actually-is-cheaper-than-government-sponsored-insurance/)

Universal Basic Income is just absurd, no matter how you do the math.  It is pretty unfeasible.  I favor an abolition of the welfare system, for the same reasons that UBI proponents do, but I propose replacing it with a negative income tax, EITC, or FAP-type system.  UBI is too open-ended and an unnecessary burden that people like because of its simplicity, not because it's good policy.  But even all of the systems I liked, NIT, EITC+, FAP, have significant drawbacks that make them less then optimal.  Welfare is complicated.  ",,0,0,t1_cquoevo

Oh... I thought the proposition was that people were susceptible to propaganda in the form of political advertising. If that is true, wouldn't a populace who is exposed to more of that advertising be likely to vote the way it's propagandizing? But, since spending more money on advertising doesn't seem to have a statistically significant effect on voting, that can't possibly be true...

That isn't to say all spending is useless, you need to have a minimum so that people are aware of you, which is what the 538 analysis shows. But both data sets clearly show that you can't propagandize people into voting for you.

&gt;It certainly wouldn't be one of the largest business expenditures in the nation.

Total cost of the 2012 election (all races, both sides, campaign and outside money): $6.3 billion.

Even if we ignore that major elections only happen every two years and that presidential elections cost way more than midterms, it still isn't even close to the largest business expenditures in the nation each year.

There *is* a minority view that favors abortion right up til birth. Planned Parenthood, other pro-abortion groups, and individual activists among them. And they have influence in the Democratic party. This is why abortion all the way through the entire pregnancy was put into the Democratic Party's platform.

Your hospital visitation can't be determined by contract, because the hospital is under no obligation to obey your contract with a third party.

The point of marriage licenses is that you can pass a law that says, ""all hospitals must allow visitations to legally married spouses."" 

Hospitals don't want to have to hire an attorney to go through your ""joining contract"" line by line to see if it meets their definition of who should or should not be allowed visitation. 

Another problem is a concept of legal defaults. One reason we have marriage as an established concept is that it provides a default legal status for countless things. Yes, you can create a will to handle your affairs, but there is always going to be a large number of people who either don't have the time, don't have the money for  a lawyer, or are simply careless. You also have to remember and have the resources to periodically update it. There are always going to be a large number of people who can't or won't do this.

This is why marriage as a legal concept is useful. You can pass a law that says, ""if someone without a will dies unmarried and without children, their possessions go to their parents and immediate siblings. If they have a living spouse, all the possessions go to their spouse. If...etc"" 

Another very practical aspect of this is that marriage licenses provide immediate legitimacy, which greatly expedites certain business contracts. A mortgage company will grant a joint loan to a married couple that they won't grant to an unmarried couple. The reason for this is that the marriage license proves that the relationship is intended to be a long-term one, and that if the two partners can't just part ways without considerable burdens and hurdles. This shows that the relationship is serious and most likely long-lasting. Instead of having to hire an investigator to go out and judge the ""legitimacy"" of someone's romantic relationship, the marriage license serves as a pretty good approximation for this.

The second column is donations from individuals, and you can see that those numbers are way higher than the donations from organizations.

You see major banks and law firms pop up all the time in donor lists for major candidates because they represent large numbers of employees (finance industry employs 6 million Americans, legal is another million), and those employees tend to be well paid and well educated. You should expect lots of money to flow from those employees, just functioning as individuals with their own political opinions. Many of Citigroup's quarter million employees are Democrats. Many are Republicans. Even if not everyone donates, and even if the donors give a small chunk apiece, that's still going to add up to a significant amount.

Candidates who are lesser known tend to attract money from people and organizations that they would specifically benefit. We saw this with candidates like Ron Paul and Gary Johnson in the past. The military liked them because of their foreign policy; having a president who probably won't send you on a lovely vacation to the Middle East would be pretty awesome. So they received a relatively large chunk of change from the military, and next to nothing from banks and lawyers (why back someone who's guaranteed to lose and who wouldn't bring you much advantage?). That's happening again with Sanders. He doesn't have much of a shot at winning, and he only just announced. He's receiving relatively little (his top donor organization gave about a third of Hillary's 20th). And that makes sense! But because he is so pro-labor and would be so great for the unions, those unions are popping to the top of his list (notice how even then, he's primarily getting the money straight from the organizations rather than from individuals, unlike Hillary). If he became a serious threat to Hillary and started to attract real attention, and especially if he won the Democratic primary, you'd start seeing the same names crawl up his list.",,0,0,t1_cqup0hz

The bottom line is this: Capitalism is global, and it is relentless. The State operates as a functionary of the will of the capitalist class. Washington is entirely beholden to this class - at times they will be far-sighted and throw behind ""leftist"" politicians during times of dissent and unrest so they can ride out the storm.

As soon as the storm subsides, they bring back their heavy hitters (Reagan, Bush, etc).

If you think that political action stops at voting for Bernie Sanders, you are dreadfully mistaken. The Democratic Party wants you to stop at voting for their chess piece. 

To quote Mao Zedong, ""Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun"". Unless Americans declare a war against capitalism and the exploitation of the working class around the world, and the Western imperialism which exploits the 3rd world's labor for its own, then progressive society will never be realized.

Electoral reform is quite probably the most important issue for the long term(in the short term, no it isn't) which is why I think it's so important to get someone like Bernie to be seen as a serious contender.

There are without doubt many other extremely important issues out there, on the majority of which Clinton is on the right side. The problem is that with current electoral systems representation is moved from the people to the sponsors whom candidates must spend inordinate amounts of time wooing. Without changing that, effective change in other areas, change based on the will of the people is unwieldy and often near impossible.

I do not for a second believe that Bernie can achieve everything he would like to.

The progressive movement in the US could be traced back to the transcendentalist movement, which was unitarian, not Christian. Henry David Thoreau wrote *Resistance to Civil Government* (which was a major influence to both Gandhi and Rev. King) eleven years before Bryan was born. 

After the civil war, transcendentalism faded away and the labor rights movement took off. Christian socialists played a roll, for sure, but there is no denying the roll of a blatantly irreligious socialist movement in the United States. And it was extraordinarily popular. Bryan may have been a dominant political figure in Washington, but the Socialist Party of America, led by Eugene V. Debs, played a significant roll in bringing about progressive reforms through direct action and local electoral politics. Debs received 6% of the popular vote in the 1912 Presidential election, and 3% in 1920... when he was serving a ten year sentence in prison for sedition because he called on the American people to refuse to fight in WWI. Woodrow Wilson certainly thought Debs was more of a threat to traditional politics than Bryan.

Ultimately, the progressive reforms of the early twentieth century arose from the actions of the people, tirelessly struggling against the status quo, demanding that their needs be met and that economic policy reflect the moral principles that all decent men and women value. 

Sanders is not a savior. There is no such thing. At most, he is a public figure that is useful to the ends of the people. He will only be useful towards those ends if we push him to do as we will.",,1430468241,0,t1_cqupc0d

Secondly, gerrymandering--as can plainly be seen by the above study--isn't much of a problem, has been around since before the term was coined in 1812, and is part of the US democratic, electoral process. The disparity in representation is a direct result of the Constitutional allocation of Representatives which exists because of federalism.

Seriously.  

In what way?

&gt;Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is preparing to push the role of the individual-candidate super PAC to new, brazen heights.

&gt;The Bush campaign is reportedly planning to reverse the role of Bush’s campaign committee and the “independent” super PAC supporting him — so that the super PAC would essentially become Bush’s campaign committee.

&gt;The reason for this audacious move is simple: super PACs can be funded with unlimited donations, while a candidate’s campaign is limited to contributions of $2,700 per donor per election. A relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires could pay for Bush’s race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.

http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/04/22/why-jeb-bushs-super-pac-plan-is-potentially-illegal/

It's a lot easier to find him if you decide you want to look for him and commit priority and resources to it.

Conversely the Bush administration, ironically with false information gained via torture, had incorrectly decided that OBL was basically a figurehead and not an operational leader.  As such they didn't consider him a priority.

If your point is that Obama had a victory on this one by basically not being Bush and that anyone moderately intelligent would have made the same choices... I can't argue with that.

But he was moderately intelligent in an area where the previous guy wasn't and that's hard to argue with.

I'm not saying the government should be involved; I'm saying it's pretty much the best option we currently have for today's world. It's not perfect - certainly needs some reform - but it does come with some good.

&gt;Just because something is hard to do right and requires some awkward moments and forethought at the beginning of a cohabitation doesn't mean we should do it incorrectly and rely on the govt to pick up the pieces.

Agree with you here.

&gt;Humans have done this since prehistory without the involvement of large outside power structures, I think we could be just fine doing it that way again.

I'm not saying it can't be done this way today, but it certainly can't be done by a lot of people. That's why I brought up how nasty marriages/divorces can get even now, with the state arbitrating. That only gets worse if those same couples have to work it out for themselves.

Humans were able to do this without an outside authority because most cultures throughout most eras gave absolute control of the family to the oldest living male.

And since at least 1960, bills that have majority support in the Senate have often subject to defeat by a minority who effectively prevents voting them through.

As for here CAFTA / NAFTA swap, it says it right there. 

&gt; Clinton’s views on NAFTA have shifted, but they shifted prior to her official run for the White House. Back in 1998, in a keynote speech given at the Davos Economic Summit, Clinton praised business leaders for mounting “a very effective business effort in the US on behalf of NAFTA,“ adding later that ”it is certainly clear that we have not by any means finished the job that has begun.“ But by 2005 she was expressing reservations about free trade agreements, voting that year against the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). And she told Bloomberg News in March 2007 that, while she still believes in free trade, she supports a freeze on new trade agreements--something she calls ”a little time-out.“

Her views changed. [And as for her position on TPP, she's in agreement with Elizabeth Warren and is opposed to the TPP in its current form](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/30/hillary-clinton-trans-pacific-partnership_n_7173108.html). Anyway, she's quoted as being in favor of ""a little time-out"" from new trade agreements. That's back in 2007, so perhaps now that it's nearly a decade later, she feels we're done with our ""timeout"" and we can move forward with a comprehensive agreement like TPP.

I'm not real clear on every aspect of this, I can honestly claim ignorance as to her stance here. What I can say is that it appears she's taken a common sense approach to TPP by being against its most absurd aspect (the company being able to sue countries).

As for the copyright stuff (the other thing reddit hates), I have a different position on it than you guys. I'm a patent attorney and have extensive experience with copyright law. Strong IP enforcement abroad is extremely beneficial for the US economy. Billions and billions of dollars are ""lost"" every year because of lax enforcement and getting even a fraction of that back would be a good thing (there are other reasons too, but it's 11 pm on the West coast and I have get to bed so I can get up for work in the AM). So if she's in favor of the copyright stuff (and therefore in lockstep with basically everyone who's actually in the IP world), the more power to her.

-------------

On a side note, it's not necessarily useful for me to engage in every debate that every commentor makes, particularly when it's an issue I am not 100% certain on (I did have to do 5 minutes of research before starting this novella). On /r/politics these last few weeks, a majority of my posts end up getting downvoted to oblivion and the few people who engage me often are the most zealous of Sanders/Warren supporters. I'm not going to convince anyone to change their mind and swap from Sanders supporters to Hillary supporters. 

What I AM trying to do though is convince people that Hillary is not a bad bargain. Reddit seems to be of the opinion that it's either Sanders or ""stay home on election day"". THAT'S the way we lose the general and I want to convince people that Hillary is a ""good enough"" candidate that supports a majority of the things they care about. Because in reality she's exactly that.

Snce the rates published by ASU don't have one that is 3 times a different one.

&gt; If I were looking for an advanced degree and employed, I would definitely look into online courses.

In a lot of MBA programs you work with a partner.  

Otherwise, on a course-by-course basis it really depends.  A seminar just doesn't work well on-line.  And I would not want any course where I could not send in an actual question I had and have a professor or teaching assistant answer it.  Particularly if the question concered credit on an assignment or exam and I had reason show what what I answered had significant value. 

If you can't communicate that, you might be SOL. 

I've been in a MOOC where they crowd-sourced the advice system and, although the class was quite good, that aspect of it was abysmal.

It depends on what facilities are provided and the nature of the course.

To me it's the abundance of easy solutions to complicated problems - ""tax the rich"", ""create more jerbs"", ""no more outsourcing"" etc. These are fairly standard liberal views that often don't hold up (without modification) in the face of real considerations. For example, although devoting tax money to infrastructure improvements to ""create"" jobs sounds like an easy solution, it ignores the fact that an overwhelming majority of such projects (as attempted eg by actual populists in Latin American states) constitute capital destruction from a purely economic standpoint.

Similarly, offshoring jobs is one of those easy soundbites that makes people fume, but that is backed by solid economic principles that to some degree ignore partisanship. 

Now, I know you won't agree with my assessment of the policy questions as such, but my point is rather that  populism in its essence is not partisan - it's about ignoring the obvious tried and true counter-arguments in your messaging. In that sense, a significant amount of American candidates have been populist to some degree. 

To reinforce my point with an example from the other side of the spectrum: tea partiers' insistence on eliminating the debt arguably stems from a limited understanding of the underlying economics as well as the trade-offs involved. The populism lies in not (publicly) recognizing that these issues are extremely complicated. Populism thrives on the fact that the average voter has a five second attention span and that a candidate who recognizes complexity will never, ever stand a chance. ",,0,0,t1_cqu0low

I disagree 100% on Sharpton, he is nothing but a racist agitator,  FBI snitch,  ratting on black activists as well as white mobsters by the way. When he falsely accused an honest public official in the Tawana Brawley Case of a rape that he knew never happened he should have lost all credibility in the national conversation. Somehow johnnie Cochran decided to pay the civil judgment against Sharpton.  Al like the govt will tell you to the tune of over 4.5 million dollars, does not pay his bills. He should have also lost all credibility when he made racist comments against whites/Jews/Mormons and many others .   Somehow he gets a pass where a white person on the national stage  would never get one in a million years. Sometimes the unfair double standards go in the other direction. 
I am curious why do you think white people are uncomfortable with him ""talking about real issues"" ? You think we don't know what the real issues are? We see the crime and incarceration rates. We see the unemployment rate for young black males, we don't get an education from Al, I can guarantee you that.  We see first hand he does nothing to address real issues, he just complains about them. Racist white people LOVE THE AL SHARPTONS of the world. There will never be anything gained by the black community when good old Rev Al steps into a situation. People who are truly against the black community are very happy to see Rev Al get involved,  progress and positive messages get stopped in their tracks when Al pops in. ",,0,1,t1_cquret4

&gt; Republican legislators and governors drew district lines for 173 of the 435 seats in Congress.[9] Where Republican legislators controlled redistricting, Republicans likely won 11 more seats than they would have under the old district lines. Five of these 11 were seats that flipped party control due to redistricting; six were Republican seats saved by redistricting. **In states where Republicans controlled redistricting, Republican candidates for the House won roughly 53 percent of the vote and 72 percent of the seats. But even under the old district lines, that disparity would have persisted, as Republicans still would have likely won about 65 percent of the seats.**

&gt; Democratic legislators and governors redistricted 44 seats, just one-quarter the number of seats as Republicans.[10] But they still used redistricting to their advantage. Where they controlled redistricting, Democrats won three more seats than they would have under the old district lines, and Republicans lost five more seats. **In the six states where Democrats controlled redistricting, Democratic candidates for the House won about 56 percent of the vote and 71 percent of the seats. However, that disparity would have persisted even before redistricting, as Democrats would have likely won 61 percent of the seats under the old district lines.**

So what they're saying here may be a little unclear to the reader. It doesn't imply that the previous district boundaries were reasonable.

What it does say flat out is that in Republican-controlled states Republican candidates won 53% of the vote and 72% of the seats, versus the 65% of seats they would have won under the old already-Gerrymandered district lines.

It also says flat out that in the Democratic-controlled states, Democratic candidates got 56% of the vote but won 71% of the seats. That is an increase from 61% under the previous already-gerrymandered district lines.

In fact, the article you linked to doesn't contain a single instance of the word ""gerrymander"" or ""gerrymandered"".

The statistics you posted indicate some very substantial increases of the difference between the percentage of seats that would have been won based on voting percentage versus the percentage that were won based on the new district guidelines. This seems to me like a very good indication that gerrymandering is being used effectively to make the results not match the votes. And again, yes, the study I originally linked to was for North Carolina specifically, but it did indicate that there were almost no way that certain particular things could have happened without gerrymandering, like saying
&gt; Nonetheless it is interesting to note the racial makeup of the districts created by
our model and compare them to the current figures. Figure 7 gives the results for
the African American and Hispanic populations. Our samples never produced a majority
African American district. 

So when creating a system to draw district guidelines based on possible priorities that could be used and that were not specifically intending to isolate African-American voters into just two districts, their models  **never** produced a majority African-American district.

Saying that nationally ""The Republicans won about 6 more seats than they would have under the old district lines,"" is **not** the same as saying ""The Republicans won about 6 more seats than they would have under reasonable district lines.""

And this isn't to say that Democrats didn't gerrymander. The fact that Republicans gerrymander does not mean that Democrats didn't gerrymander where they had power. The ""only six seats"" thing is a red herring in so many different ways. It's also not like ""Well all seats are districted reasonably, except these six gerrymandered seats."" The ""six seats"" thing is such a useless bit of information for this discussion.

And really, ""It's been done since 1812 and it should be done that way because it's always been that way,"" is **not** an argument.",,1430463855,0,t1_cqurf8l

Most people who can, you know, do math would tell you, if you're trying to appeal to the center, moving left is going to be less populist and get you less votes.

The most likely candidate is Rep. Castor's [D-FL] [""Permanent Investment in Health Research Act of 2015""](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/777). Which would set the 2016 NIH budget to $32 billion, almost $2 billion above the 2015 FY amount of $30.3 billion, and finally an increase from the $31.2 billion in FY 2010, which was the recent peak. It would also set future appropriations up to FY 2025 at that amount plus adjustment for increases in GDP. It has 6 cosponsors, all Democrats.

Another possibility are a pair of bills in [House](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/531) and [Senate](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/531) called the ""Accelerating Biomedical Research Act"" introduced by Rep. DeLauro (D-CT) and Sen. Mikulski (D-MD). They loosen budgetary restrictions created by the sequester on the NIH, allowing them more funding. Together they have 25 cosponsors, all of them Democrats.

On a slightly different track are [Rep. Van Hollen [D-MD]](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/744/text) and [Sen. Warren [D-MA]'s](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/320/text) bills called the ""Medical Innovation Act of 2015"" which raises funds by some arcane mechanism that seems to be targeted at drug manufacturers who sell drugs that were produced in part as the product of federal science investment who have had a settlement of some lawsuit dealing with dangers they posed to public health. The funds raised would be allocated to both the FDA and the NIH, in some balance. It also has some provisions to try to stop Congress from just cutting FDA and NIH funding and then ""supplementing"" it back using these funds. Together these bills have 7 cosponsors, all Democrats.

Less likely to be what this story is about, but very similar, is Sen. Durbin (D-NY)'s [""American Cures Act""](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/289/text) which does the same thing as the Accelerating Biomedical Research act (partially lifting sequestration), but on a variety of health research institutions, including the NIH and CDC.

There are many ways to get around the requirement to not directly collaborate with the candidate, like making one of the very good friends of the candidates the head of the PAC, or how if you just publically say what you want ads to say the PAC can then just follow that.

Sending jobs to china and mexico = bad.  
Letting them come here and do the job = good?  

Bernie sanders is in the pocket of Vermont dairy farmers who can't seem to find enough American workers to do the job.  Gee I wonder why?  Nobody wants to spend all day cleaning up cow shit and baling hay for minimum wage (or less)?  How about we let American workers bargain for what they feel is a fair price for their labor and let whatever that price is be reflected in the cost of milk?  And then put tariffs on imported dairy to protect those jobs?  I would be honored to pay $10 for a gallon of milk if it supported a working class American family.  And I would be honored to help working class American families buy milk if they can no longer afford it.  I would be happy to have Scandinavia's social policies if we also had their immigration policy.  I imagine that I'd be deported pretty quickly if I tried to live and work in Norway. ",,0,1,t3_34h7fz

Companies are free to put whatever they want in the products you and I use everyday, and this Bill would require them to report each and every ingredient they use, safety reports on those ingredients, and report *any* serious adverse reactions to the FDA or risk losing their license to operate (previously it worked on the honor system).

The companies that have been manufacturing products ethically and responsibly have absolutely nothing to worry about, and this only gives those responsible brands more credibility and legitimacy. 

Conversely, this Bill includes an annual test of 5 new ingredients to ensure they are safe, so those companies that are using untested and unsafe ingredients are trying to get this Bill killed.

What I'm disagreeing with is you writing off factors that help suppress the vote. I'm not arguing people shouldn't vote, but they need to be made aware of why voting is not a magic bullet. They need to be made aware of the ways the system is rigged so some votes are worth more than other votes. 

&gt;If you want as many people to vote as possible, why not just focus on that?

Because there are other factors. Focusing on one thing while ignoring everything else that is going on is not the most productive strategy.

&gt;the best part about everyone voting is that the electoral college will reveal itself to everyone to have a significant discrepancy with the popular vote if it really isnt representative. 

There has already been ""a significant discrepancy"" in recent history, and I think it is important that everyone is aware of that.

I want more voters, but I also want voters to have an equal say in the outcome. These aren't conflicting aims.

If you tell new voters ""your vote matters"", and then they eventually realize ""my vote has almost no effect, given I'm in a gerrymandered district of a safe state"", that's probably going to turn them off of the system. Better to be honest from the beginning: ""yes your vote probably won't matter, but it is still important that everyone votes because that helps reveal the ways in which the system is rigged"".",,0,0,t1_cqusp2m

This isn't just because you suddenly get more skilled at doing things, but the more you volunteer, the more you learn about the candidate, the more you're able to share with your friends and family.  Your friends and family are far more likely to change their opinion and even volunteer if they see that it is a cause that is important to you.  

Its expected that a volunteer returning for the third time is likely to bring a friend.  You know your friend and are therefore able to train them easier than a regular staffer would be able to.  So now you're cutting back on training time and spreading the word through more than just stuffing the envelopes and dialing the phone would.

It killed me every time I spoke to somebody and they would say ""Yup, I donated 20 bucks to the campaign this week!""  Or ""How are we going to get him elected?  Oh you need me to volunteer?  Well, how bout I just vote for him instead""  Or my personal favorite ""I tell all my friends every day to vote for him.""

One aspect that I find really interesting is Documentary Hypothesis.  We have learned from writing styles and the names/nouns used that many parts of the bible were written by different people during different time periods and these stories were just combined into one book.  Someone discovered that certain passages use ""Elohim"" and some use ""Yahweh"" as the name for God and deduced (combined with other information) that they must have been written by different people.  Really fun to read the bible and analyze it from this perspective.  You can see how historical events may have influence the tones of the stories written.  This also explains why certain passages are repeated in the bible with minor differences, like how the creation story is basically told twice in a row.

This also spawmed what are basically bible fan theories.  Because the Adam and Eve story is told twice, some people figured ""Hey maybe it happened twice but it didn't work out."" and they created the idea that before Adam and Eve, God created Adam and Lilith at the same time.  Lilith didn't want to be subservient to Adam so she basically said ""Fuck you all!"" and ran off to be a demon (Feminists like Lilith).  God and Adam were like, ""Well shit."" and God created Eve to be with him instead.  Lilith got jealous and started going around causing nocturnal emissions to steal sperm to make demon babies.

One story I really love is how the covenant of God is passed through the line of Abraham (The ""chosen people"" in Judaism and Islam are thought to be those who inherited this covenant).  Abraham and his wife Sarah initially had trouble conceiving so Sarah gave her handmaiden Hagar to Abraham and they had a son named Ishmael.  Eventually Sarah and Abraham are able to have a son named Isaac so Sarah makes Arbaham send Hagar and Ismael away.  Jewish people believe that God told Abraham that his and Sarah's son would inherit the covenant so they follow the lineage of Isaac.  The Muslim faith believes that Ishmael is the true heir to the covenant and he is the ancestor of Muhammad.  I don't know why, but the idea of the two sides of this story really appeals to me.

Also there's a bunch of ridiculous stories, like when David (from david and goliath) bangs another dudes wife so he sends him to the front lines of the army to go die so people won't find out he comitted adultery.

Because he absolutely, under no circumstances, can win.  He knows it, his entire campaign knows it, and everyone who has ever visited America much less lived here knows it.

The purpose of this campaign is not winning, it is adding a liberal voice to the debate and spreading ideas in a public forum.  The key to being listened to, and the key to the entire campaign, is to be a refreshingly honest voice that tells the absolutely truth on the issues.

If Bernie's supporters walk up to people saying he can win, something even *Bernie* does not believe, then they have immediately compromised their integrity to people who might otherwise have listened to his ideas.

Superimpose a hammer and scythe over his face and you've won the argument from the perspective of that segment of the electorate. There are a lot of moderates who would get queasy when faced with the same argument. The difference between people not wanting to vote for Obama because he is black and not wanting to vote for Sanders because he's a socialist is that most people would not want the former preference widely known. The latter, even if it's based on a flawed understanding of political, economic and social theory and history, is a badge of honor.  It's that radioactive in conservative America and a very hard sell to the middle of the spectrum. 

If Sanders starts out the general with that kind of visceral misperception working against him, the only thing that could counter it is a shit ton of money to let him run the table with the remainder of voters and generate immense turnout.

That's a linguistic tool to evoke emotion. Like ""terrorists"", ""flip-flopper"", and ""liberal"", which was a perfectly good term before being soured with repeated negative context in, what... the 80's? And if you get your keyword trending and into the media, even if it's just in the background, people relate to you when you say it. Then it compounds its emotional attachment on some mental database where recalling language happens. Kinda like SEO, where words trend and swarm into the gravity wells of ""competitive keywords"".

The brass ring is controlling what words become key phrases. If you do that, you set the connotations for the keywords that everyone will have to use during the end game, stacking them in your favor. Advantage you.

So maybe we should come up with new keywords/phrases on the issues that need it. Make them good and fit within 30 characters. We're already using the greatest series of tubes ever built for that kind of thing, so we should be able to come up with something, right?

tl;dr: Try replacing the phrase ""mainstream media"" with ""traditional media"" instead. Put CNN and other 24 hour news networks in the same boat as the dinosaur that is the old print newspaper.

I don't know how that works in the various US states, but why should the government decide you are more deserving of tax advantages if you are married. A lot of couples these days choose to live together and have kids, but don't get married.

With traditional TV and newspapers you're broadcasting your story, policies, unique selling point etc to a mass audience. Which is why so many politicians broadcast very broad messages that ""appeal to the every wo/man"". But that means your points end up falling to the two-party system: liberal vs conservative.

With the Internet and social media you have access to demographic information right down to the individual level. Some intelligent data mining and recommendation algorithms can automatically cater your political message to appeal to that individual.

Then you repeat the same for every only group/niche. All of the specific Facebook groups, forums, subreddits, blog networks etc. Then you do the same again a level higher, targeting the different cultures on Reddit, Tumblr, Facebook, Pinterest etc.

In that sense you're hitting the longtail of the voting populace, automatically catering your political message at every level and gracefully focusing that message as you move from the mediums of one-to-many down to one-to-one.

And the great thing is that if anyone tries to call you out on what you're doing, nobody will care as it will remain within the online filter bubbles, and only results in the message being spread further. Or you just blame shitty advertising algorithms.",,0,0,t1_cqutzow

Communism is an example of being right on the first axis and left on the second. Fascism is double right, Anarchism is double left, and something like Libertarianism is left on the first and right on the second.

This is looking at political theory from the outside and creating an axis system to measure all of them on a four quadrant graph.

Someone like Stalin and Hitler would have agreed on the nature of authority, but disagreed economically. An Anarchist and Libertarian would agree on the nature of feedom, but not on economics.

Never look at a political ideology as a member. Never be a member of an ideology. Stand outside of them and look in. Pick and choose the useful bits of each when appropriate.

Never limit your toolbox. Ensure it contains tools from every political ideology because any of them could be useful in a given situation. Always be a pragmatist, never an idealist.",,1430478582,0,t1_cquli3z

Super Pacs are such a scam. It's sort of cool to see an actual grassroots candidate. If you want to help him out, make your own campaign signs and t shirts and fund him with small contributions.

Part of Ron Paul's campaign success was due to his grassroots support. He didn't have to pay for that blimp or nothing. Bernie's biggest hurdle is that the media is corporate and he's challenging one of the ways they influence elections. They'll bury him if they can.

There was a discussion the other day on Reddit about the distribution of funding for schools. The common issue people brought up is that individuals hated the idea of their money helping others. This perpetuates a problem of richer areas getting better schools. The political Right has done a great job painting a picture of the needy being lazy freeloaders. These people see what their hard work has brought them and despise the idea that their quality of life could just be handed to someone. I wouldn't call it ""wrong or missing"" education rather a unrealistic and selfish view of the American Dream. 

Edit: I should clarify the line ""people hated the idea of their money helping others"". First, this isn't an American wide issue, there were specific areas mentioned and a lot of hypothetical thinking involved. Second, its more of a crab bucket mentality like someone correctly pointed out. Sure, if we all work together and knock over the bucket,  everyone will be better off but the idea of helping others before yourself isnt always easy. In my opinion, it requires a culture where being self-centered makes you an outlier rather then the opposite reality that exists in these areas.",,1430487751,0,t1_cquvaw7

Moral. Money wins campaigns. Obama raised over a billion in 2012. Romney a little less than that. Bernie will stick to his values. Reddit will love him for that. 

But he needs more than the applause of Reddit to win. He needs political infrastructure in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. That's what money gets you. Turnout. And I'm sorry, there just aren't enough grannies writing $5 checks to compete with a Clinton Machine's big dollar donors.

Any time you donate to a candidate you need to provide the name of your employer. Many of those companies have 100k+ employees and have an HQ in NY, so it makes sense that they are 'highest contributors'.

This is also over the career of the candidate. Hillary has run for NY Senate many times and had a presidential bid. 

Citigroup, #1,  has ~250,000 employees and gave 770k over Hillary's political career.

Skadden, #8, has ~4000 employees, is based in NY and gave about half of what Citi did. But, no one cares about them, because it isn't an 'evil bank'.  They're a law firm. And lawyers have given Hillary the most. Possibly because NY has a ton of them.

You can also confirm it.  Just [head over to the Federal Election Commission](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/advindsea.shtml) site. Check and see whose giving to who. Type in Citibank and I get a buncha people donating to their PAC (which gave Hillary $8k TOTAL). 

Some people I found (not listing names):

$250 to obama in 2012. What's he do? Quick google shows he's a project manager in indiana for citi.

Does this seriously make any sense?

A basic income is an income floor. It provides everyone security from poverty, and is not taken away with income from labor market work. All income earned on top of it is kept.

Although Hilary is very likable, the major problem I have with most politicians is that they never do *enough*. Bernie's sense of urgency is like a breath of fresh air, and nobody else even comes close. For me, just voting Democrat is not enough anymore.

**Show me where other races come close to the crime and violence of the culture of broken family blacks?**

  * If liberals cared about blacks, they'd have fixed the school systems in cities like Chicago and Detroit.  Yet after generations of liberal Democrat rule, the blacks in those cities still get horrible educations.  But the teachers in those cities get great pay even though they fail miserably at their jobs.  Why?  Perhaps it has  something to do with the huge support the teachers' unions give to Democrat candidates.
If liberals really cared about the poor, they'd give more of their own money to charity.  Yet liberals tend to give less of their own money to charities than conservatives do.  Why?  Perhaps it's because by laundering money to help the poor through the government, the liberals get a trifecta: they control how the money is spent, they get high-paying jobs with great benefits in government, and they don't have to actually part with any of their own money.  If liberals cared about blacks, they'd join with Jesse Jackson's former condemnation of abortion as racist genocide.  Abortion is the leading cause of death for blacks in America; black women are five times more likely to have an abortion than white women – yet liberals are staunch supporters of abortion.  Why?  Perhaps because liberals favor a hedonistic lifestyle where sex is a casual thing.  In a 1981 poll, 54% of media elites didn't think adultery is wrong, and since no form of birth control is perfect, abortion is a necessity if sex is to be without consequences.  Perhaps the racist roots of modern liberals – Democrats founded the KKK and the segregation laws of the South – plays a role, too.

It's easy to see that the police are rarely held accountable for their wrong doing, whether that be drug related, assaults, corruption, etc. The superiors get away with this intimidation because the DA's are reluctant to prosecute and ruin a good relationship with the PD (which makes it all the more difficult to prosecute cases).

1) Hilary looks inevitable.  Iowa is the first ""primary"".  Hilary winning it isn't just delegate points.  It is the brick in her ""inevitable"" wall, which until now has been a blueprint.  Winning Iowa disrupts the Hilary narrative at a key point.


2) This may just be one of [those sayings](https://xkcd.com/1122/), but I recall that back in 2008 people were saying Iowa is an odd state because of how conservative it is.  For the GOP primaries it tends to go for people far out of line with the general population.  However, the Dem primary voters tend to be in-line with the general U.S. voters.  So Bernie winning Iowa, if this view is true and not just false ""common knowledge"", means he has a legit chance at winning the General instead of just being an Overton Window shifter in the primary.

If the initial value is 100k, and you sold them for 1.1M....then your capital gains would be 1M....and your tax assessment would be whatever percentage you qualify for for the 1M realized for the sale (varies state to state and depends on length of investment). My entire point in this whole conversation is that you should pay nothing unless you sell something....I get no money from an asset that I do not sell. So those that inherit property receive no financial compensation from that property unless they sell it....yet you think they should pay taxes on that property when they get it. And no, I am not talking about stocks or bonds or anything else that pays out a quarterly dividend. However, those items that pay out dividends are already subject to capital gains so I'm not sure where you think taxing tangible inheritances is doing anybody any good.

He also has a moderately pro-gun-control voting record. 

That being said, despite the socialist thing, moderates might still vote for him since he's clearly not bought and paid like the rest of the candidates are. He was an Independent before this week.  Maybe I'm just being naive and optimistic, but I think Americans are fed up with the two-party system and the corruption rampant in Washington. There were liberals who voted for Ron Paul in the primaries in 2012. I know, because I was one of them. Maybe conservatives and moderates might vote for a socialist given similar circumstances.

Duh. The democrats love their racist policy.

Min wage makes it too expensive to give unskilled blacks a job.

The democrat run cities have the worst inner city schools.

Prohibition is progressive. Democrats are the most progressive party we have. They love taxing cigarettes and dope.

  * If liberals cared about blacks, they'd have fixed the school systems in cities like Chicago and Detroit.  Yet after generations of liberal Democrat rule, the blacks in those cities still get horrible educations.  But the teachers in those cities get great pay even though they fail miserably at their jobs.  Why?  Perhaps it has  something to do with the huge support the teachers' unions give to Democrat candidates.
If liberals cared about blacks, they'd join with Jesse Jackson's former condemnation of abortion as racist genocide.  Abortion is the leading cause of death for blacks in America; black women are five times more likely to have an abortion than white women – yet liberals are staunch supporters of abortion.  Why?  Perhaps because liberals favor a hedonistic lifestyle where sex is a casual thing.  In a 1981 poll, 54% of media elites didn't think adultery is wrong, and since no form of birth control is perfect, abortion is a necessity if sex is to be without consequences.  Perhaps the racist roots of modern liberals – Democrats founded the KKK and the segregation laws of the South – plays a role, too.

First, while we have a very high college ATTENDANCE rate, our college GRADUATION rate is not nearly that much higher than other developed countries.  

Second, while we have some elite schools, the difference in the quality of education is marginal at best; the biggest difference is in the segregation of inputs - you rarely make a sow's ear out of a silk purse - because the best schools have students who are super-elite in terms of intelligence and (in many cases) level of preparation and schooling before college.  Even assuming the quality of America's best schools means something on its own, the aggregate average quality of America's post-secondary education isn't better.  It's not.

But unless there is more than a small marginal increase in the quality of education, your argument is DRASTICALLY counterbalanced by the extremely high cost of education here and our overwhelming levels of student debt.  Now. it seems you lean ""American Libertarian"" (i.e. a minarchist capitalist propertarian).  So you probably argue that it's the subsidies for loans that are driving up the prices.  Indeed, that is partially true.  But the flipside is that without subsidized loans, college would once again become primarily the province of the upper middle class. Middle and low-income individuals would have a much more difficult time ""taking a risk"" and investing in their own human capital because they would have to take out private loans; the lower income they come from the less likely they would be to receive a loan, the higher interest rates they would receive, the less likely they are to be able to procure a co-signer of sufficiently high income, etc...

That's why controlling supply AND pricing for education is the best model and why it's worked so well around the world for producing educated people who can enter the workforce without debt, while also paying to give sufficient practical skills to those not as well suited to higher education.  And yeah, central planning is especially well suited to macro problems like this.

Conversely, if you want to lead to permanent ""meritocratic"" stratification - and mean meritocracy in its original dystopian sense, where rigid economic class systems self-perpetuate over generations because the children of the educated and wealthy can give their children skills that make them more ""meritorious"" than those from other classes - then your solution is great.

Third, your argument about theoretic dead weight losses from taxation is absurd.  From the article you linked:  ""Tax labor and people work less. Tax capital and people save less. Tax gasoline and people buy less gas, etc.""  While taxing investment capital does encourage spending at the expense of savings - which most Keynesians and also heterodox economists would say is good for the economy generally and specifically in our economic context, given that the share of income returning to capital rather than labor has been increasing for decades - the other assertions are just not true. Taxing labor has several possible impacts, but while there is a leisure preference that would increase if marginal income decreases, there is a countervailing pressure to work MORE because income is being taxed at a higher rate and so to maintain the same after-tax lifestyle one needs to earn more income. Of course even those arguments ignore the effects of social welfarism which act as an indirect return to the taxpayer and thus actually balance the scales to some degree outside of these competing incentives/disincentives. In any case, the ""high tax disincentivizes labor"" argument really has no empirical validity, even as it has little theoretic validity.  Moreover, while people do use less gas if it costs more, gasoline is only a moderately elastic good, especially in the U.S. where we have poorer public transport and longer distances to travel given suburban sprawl.  Healthcare is, however, much more inelastic; people NEED it. And people don't go to the doctor for funsies either, which is why primary care visits and wellness checks, etc... are only a little bit higher in ""Free at the point of service"" than they are here. 

And even beyond these more specific arguments, the reality is that a nation's aggregated tax rate has NO correlation to economic growth.  AGAIN, taxes as a percentage of GDP show no statistically meaningful correlation to economic growth rate in developed countries.  Repetition there may be pedantic but ultimately I take empirical evidence over theoretic models in economics each and every time.

Which gets me to the crux of my opposition to your standpoint about ""thinking singlepayer would be an inferior system"": it's empirically invalid. We have comparator nations with similar health outcomes, and every one of those nations spends less in absolute and PPP adjusted GDP on healthcare than we do.  And we don't have to granulate the data to ""just employer sponsored care"", because on a per-procedure basis, these nations spend far less than we do, whether compared to Medicare reimbursement and expenditure rates, Medicaid's reimbursement rates, and/or the average of the private health insurance sector's per-procedure reimbursement rates.  Canada's specific health outcomes are equal or marginally superior to us on a treatment-by-treatment, disease-by-disease basis (so not just relying on life expectancies) and the consistently spend 60 to 65% of what we do on healthcare.  And they are a close comparator culturally and even in broad health metrics (they are the third most obese nation, we are the second (Mexico is the first)).

And all of THAT doesn't even take into account the marginal value of additional healthcare for those who find themselves on the wrong side of our wealth-based health rationing.  And, yeah, that still holds with PPACA, such as in the case of Bronze high deductible plans that place the risk of high expenditures on workaday individuals who can't afford it.  A huge percentage of the population has $10k in net worth or less (40% plus) and most of the net worth held by poorer and lower middle class individuals is tied up in housing (not easily liquidated and poses an additional burden if liquidated due to rental costs, which include profit-seeking by holders of land capital) which means that one usually has to have a good deal of savings to possibly deal with healthcare costs in any one year.

OKAY, but on to UBI: Yeah, EITC is more effective than UBI in terms of economic efficiency. EITC was politically popular across the spectrum but because its now used as a cudgel (see Romney and the 47% comment for Exhibit A, as it negatively implicates EITC by necessity) to demonize the working poor. However, EITC does not suffice on its own because it only addresses people who work.  Worse still, EITC perpetuates the moralist's argument that one must labor to earn one's keep.  This is one factor that has led to the rise of the neoluddites, as technology really DOES pose the possibility of eliminating a lot of productive labor in a way that the industrial revolution did not, especially given that intellectual labor can be iteratively self-reproduced by sufficiently advanced technology (which is on the near horizon given computing power increases and not a comic book fantasy).  I guess what I'm saying is that conditioning welfare on work is more a moral argument than a utilitarian argument, as people would likely experience more utility having free time to choose their endeavors than they would working at ""bullshit jobs"" (to steal the term from David Graeber), especially as those jobs can more cheaply be replaced by technology.  The other outcome to EITC in a shrinking labor market would be to incentivize the dissolution of the minimum wage, thus resulting in a race to the bottom against technology (the only way to keep technology at bay AND receive EITC would be to accept lower wages, and thus work more jobs at lower hours, then because of increased competition for low end jobs due to those with two-jobs, wages fall even MORE, etc...).

BUT, even beyond that, I'm glad we are paternalistic with some of our healthcare benefits and I'm glad many of services are provided by the government and not the market.  The reality is that EITC AND UBI would be a disaster for those who the market has and will continue to deprive of high quality education, high quality social services, etc... That's because, for all of the theoretic models based on some variety of homo economicus, reality interjects with a curse word and a shake of the head.  People are not rational actors and the less education and income one has, the less rational one can be.  IF you don't have the money to purchase skills, the skills to mine information, or the money to purchase information, then you are going to be at a huge disadvantage in the market.  Indeed, any expression of preferences based on imperfect information will not be an expression of preference at all.  That's because preference expression is an exchange value, and functionally speaking exchange value is simple ""predicted use value"".  If your predictions are shit because your information is shit and you are racked by cognitive biases due to your information deficit, then your predictions will be bad, ergo you may well get a net consumer deficit instead of a consumer surplus that is supposed to occur from trade. Food stamps are a good example of a policy that is better than UBI despite its shortfalls; black market trading is only a small factor with food stamps and instead most of the money actually goes to food for a family in need instead of going to less efficient allocations of capital. That's also why I like public housing, council estates, and even Section 8 over subsuming all those programs into UBI or expanded EITC. Moreover, marginal losses are most devastating for the poor.  Thus, the losses they suffer from poor information... are the WORST things our society can suffer.",,1430485907,0,t1_cqupeji

Governments aren't good at being as efficient as possible in many spaces (although they are good at some!)

That said I am actually pro-tax and pro-redistribution. I think the idea of 'rich schools' and 'poor schools' is absurd. We should have a basic standard of living. We should focus more on ensuring equality of opportunity because that doesn't just happen. We need to spend money to try to help the poor kid do better.

Sanders has a very large and dedicated following, but let's not pretend like he connects to country-wide public opinion on that level.

But it's hard to argue about the effectiveness of that ""secrecy"" attack--you see commenters here and writers elsewhere repeating that line over and over.

Here's what Obama said:

&gt; Obama seemed to implicitly reference Warren's response on the call on Friday, noting that members of Congress can now view the text of the pact and will have months to review the agreement before voting on the final version.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Every single one of the critics saying this is a secret deal, or send out e-mails to their fundraising base that they're working to stop a secret deal, could walk over and see the text of the agreement,"" Obama said. ""When I just keep on hearing people repeating this notion that it's secret -- I gotta say, it's dishonest. And it's a little concerning when I see friends of mine resorting to those sort of tactics.""

The drafts of the agreement are kept secret from the public--just like they are for every international agreement, and for good reason.  The agree-upon sections are available to Congresspeople.  And once the agreement is finalized, the full text will be available to everyone before the Senate votes to either approve it or reject it.

How can an average American citizen possibly cast a vote for a party that is determined to not just stagnate this country's progress, but move us backward into an era where women are treated as inferior persons. Where gays are ridiculed and forced to keep a secret instead of living life as who they are and contributing to the greater good of society. How do people not remember how angry they were in 2008, when republican policies pushed us to the brink of another depression? How do they forgive congress' latest government shutdown which not just cost billions, but temporarily took away the only lifeline some of our people had? How was an unemployed person who had exhausted his savings supposed to afford gas to drive to an interview when his federal unemployment check was held hostage by a single party's hissy fit over insuring more people?
How do we not remember the ignorance of this party? How do we not remember that Republican control means lower taxes for the wealthy, higher burden on the middle class and not even single ply toilet paper for the poor to wipe their ass? How do we not remember the two wars the last administration conned this country into? How are we so mad at Obama when every metric of our quality of life has improved in the six years he's taken over. No, Obama and the Democrats aren't perfect, but at least they're trying to move us forward. I just don't understand this country sometimes. I don't understand how anyone can believe their local Republican politician cares about their future.
I suppose so many voters today recalled a time when America was the undisputed best country in the world. And they see the Republicans try to keep the same ideals that were in place 50 years ago while the Democrats try to adapt.

The concept of Yahweh was formalized in the 6th century BC and marriage predates that by a long shot.

The political landscape of a state with 600,000 people vs. trying to win a Democratic presidential candidacy in 50 states is a hugely different scenario. If you can't see this, then God help you. It's one man and a bunch of microdonations vs. people with the resources to actually make that happen.

&gt;What do you think he could do with the backing of the Democratic party?

What exactly do you mean when you say ""the backing of the Democratic party?"" Party backing means financial backing - and some of that money comes from the ""billionaires"" you speak of, which then leaves your candidate with two options:

&gt;[In my opinion, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) is a “law respecting an establishment of religion” that violates the First Amendment to the Constitution. ***If the historic landmark on the hill in Boerne happened to be a museum or an art gallery owned by an atheist, it would not be eligible for an exemption from the city ordinances that forbid an enlargement of the structure.*** Because the landmark is owned by the Catholic Church, it is claimed that RFRA gives its owner a federal statutory entitlement to an exemption from a generally applicable, neutral civil law. Whether the Church would actually prevail under the statute or not, ***the statute has provided the Church with a legal weapon that no atheist or agnostic can obtain. This governmental preference for religion, as opposed to irreligion, is forbidden by the First Amendment.***](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/95-2074.ZC.html)

As I've said elsewhere, the solution to this isn’t necessarily to invalidate RFRA. It could be to extend RFRA to apply to deeply held secular convictions, as Justice Harlan suggested in his concurrence in the result in [Welsh v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/398/333/case.html).  But I do believe that there is still an issue even if RFRA is expanded to secular beliefs: whether or not a religious belief obtains an exemption is up to the state.  I believe that [entangles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_v._Kurtzman) church and state by allowing the state to establish which religious beliefs are burdened enough to receive exemptions; that should be up to the believer to determine, not the state.

Given all of this, I think the most prudent and constitutionally valid course of action is to repeal RFRA in its entirety.",,0,0,t3_34ip0o

its not inconceivable that government spending needs to be reigned in with better priorities and results, that the national teachers union has basically gutted the quality out of our public school system, that increasing taxes will reduce tax revenue by driving smart money out into less hostile foreign tax environments, and that transforming social security into something more like a sovereign wealth fund might be necessary make the social security program sustainable despite flat or declining population trends.

regarding medicare and other medical expenses - the government should cap all medical companies profit margin, to reduce patient costs and make it affordable for the country to implement a state program similar to the UK or Canada. They're probably hesitant to do that though because most of the medical innovation in the last 70years resulted from high profit margins in the medical industry attracting lots of investment, which enabled companies to produce and develop most of what's used in practice today. presumably, limiting the medical industry's profits would induce investors to divest medical companies' operating capital, and with fewer resources there'd be a slower rate of development for new drugs, devices, procedures, and equipment.

If you have a 10 million dollars in this world (just a random number), there is probably like a 90% chance you don't deserve them, but have gotten them by exploiting faults in our society. That's not how it should be, people shouldn't have to care about getting that house for their child, we should live in a world where every child gets that house if it needs it, because it has done nothing in the world different from other children. And we could if we wanted to, this world's problem is not scarcity, it's selfishness and distribution.

&gt;What kinda fucked up regulation would it take to satisfy you?

Higher taxes than you can imagine, people being payed because of their contribution to society, the very free form of capitalism we have used throughout the centuries is okayish, it got us pretty far, but we are at a point where ""demand"" and ""supply"" shouldn't be the only deciding factor in our economy. ""Need"" and ""usefulness"" need to be considered when we decide who ""deserves"" money, because that's literally simply what we do right now with our laws so there is nothing fucked up about this regulations.

E.g. a Singer gets to make millions of moneys with her/his music, because we as a society have decided that she / he deserves to make that much and we protect her/him with our laws. There is nothing ""inherently true"" about why other people are not allowed to copy the Singers stuff and sell it on their own, there was a time where that was normal in life. We simply decided at one point that that's how it has to work, because it seemed ""good"" and worked ""well enough"" and satisfied the common people. 

Maybe it's time to think about these stuff more intensely, more rational, more scientifically and from a ""what do we want from society, and how do we get there for everybody"" perspective which includes thinking about what the average person might consider ""absurd"" simply because it ""feels wrong"".

Yeah 100% inheritance tax sounds like crazy (and I'm not proposing that, just using it as a possible example of stuff to think about I myself have not thought log enough about this specific topic yet), after all we live in a word where ""works hard to provide a better future for you children"" is popularized as one of the greatest things you can do in your life, but maybe it's time to think about possibly changing these ""major opinions"" that we take as facts in our lives.",,0,0,t1_cqv0zat

I think that your heart is in the right place, but your clearly thinking emotionally rather than rationally. The scientific answer is that government can not regulate the economy efficiently, and **everyone** loses when we try to force equal living standards on everyone. What it sounds like your advocating is full fledged communism and I think history shows that is not the way forward.

When you try to use government to make everyone own everything equally what happens is that the government owns everything and the people own nothing. It's human nature that the people who run that government will abuse their power.

**Infrastructure:** 
&amp;nbsp;

Invest at least $1 trillion over five years to rebuild America. The estimate is that this $1 trillion investment will create and maintain 13 million jobs  
**Climate Change:** 
&amp;nbsp;

Millions of homes and buildings need to be weatherized, our transportation system needs to be energy efficient and we need to greatly accelerate the progress we are already seeing in wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and other forms of sustainable energy.  

**Tax Reform:** 
&amp;nbsp;

A progressive tax system in this country which is based on ability to pay  

**Social Services:** 
&amp;nbsp;

Instead of cutting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and nutrition programs, we should be expanding these programs  

**Health Care:**
&amp;nbsp;

Health care is a right, not a privilege; we must move toward a single-payer system  

**Wall Street:**
&amp;nbsp;

Today, six huge Wall Street financial institutions have assets equivalent to 61 percent of our gross domestic product – over $9.8 trillion ... They are too powerful to be reformed. They must be broken up.  

**Higher Education:**
&amp;nbsp;

Quality education in America, from child care to higher education, must be affordable for all  

**Trade:**
&amp;nbsp;

We must end our disastrous trade policies (NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, etc.) which enable corporate America to shut down plants in this country and move to China and other low-wage countries.  

**Women Equality**
&amp;nbsp;

Equal pay for equal work  

**Minimum Wage:**
&amp;nbsp;

Raise the minimum wage to a living wage — $15 an hour over the next few years

**Trade Union**
&amp;nbsp;

Legislation which makes it clear that when a majority of workers sign cards in support of a union, they can form a union.  

**Worker Co-Ops:** 
&amp;nbsp;

Provide assistance to workers who want to purchase their own businesses by establishing worker-owned cooperatives.

Think about that for a second. You want the government to say, ""you're working too hard and making too much money; you now have to stop working to allow someone else to get some of your hard-earned success."" That has a lower chance of passing in America than Putin becoming president of the US. And how would that even work for salaried employees.


&gt;reduce the number of employees based on the increase? Yes but if they needed them before, wont they still need them now?

""Need"" is a very interesting term. How many employees does a company NEED?  Think of a McDonald's. They only NEED one employee; it'd just be a shitty, slow restaurant because there's only one person to take orders, cook, and clean. Businesses don't hire/fire based on ""need""; they do on marginal benefit and marginal cost.


&gt;Businesses will hire and fire as the see fit, some hire lots of extra workers at Christmas and fire them in January.

True. Based on marginal benefit and marginal cost. The concept at play here is that retailers have a much higher marginal benefit from an extra employee during the holidays.


&gt;Raising the wage far out weighs the minute potential job losses

That's a bold statement not backed up by much, if any, credible evidence. Also, calling potential job losses minute is inaccurate (at lesst according to some economists and the CBO).",,0,0,t1_cqv09lx

Back in the 60s, the government created a huge pool of students who suddenly had the financial means to attend college - this has continued up to today.  Therefore, colleges have no motivation to ever lower costs and have instead raised them disproportionately because the pool of students keeps growing by virtue of the fact that everyone qualifies for a low interest student loan.

Figuring out someone's intentions is tricky at the best of times, and with the closest of life-long friendships.  But the only information you have to figure out someone's intent is what you're consuming in the press and in the media - which suffers from your selection bias, their reporting bias, time constraints, editing revisionism, sensationalism driven by ad revenue, etc.  

And you're going to judge someone's intentions based on that?  That's crazy.  

Hillary has had lots of donations from big wall street banks and was once on the board of directors at Wal-Mart.  But, one of her big 4 planks in her campaign is to do something about income inequality.  Should we judge her by her words?  By her donations?  How do we figure out her intent?  Surely it is possible for someone to take money from banks and still want to help rectify the income gap.  So how do we judge?

Let me put this a more practical way.  The way that Congress is structured right now, a Democratic majority is not possible in the house.  Gerrymandering has precluded that.  Therefore, nothing will get done in Congress.  So, in reality, the only thing that the next president will do that is of any consequence is replace Supreme Court judges when they retire.  Scalia can't live forever, and neither can the Notorious RBG.  Which means that the main criteria you should pick a president based on is their ability to nominate and push through a supreme court justice that you feel would be in the best interest of the country.  In that, I think Hillary and Bernie are roughly equivalent, but he doesn't have a snowball's chance of getting elected, and she is the clear frontrunner in a general election - to say nothing of primaries.",,0,0,t1_cqv37fa

4) Those powers not specifically designated to the government in the Constitution, revert to the people. (That's actually the 10th Amendment.) Is drug-enforcement *specifically* designated to the feds in the Constitution? Nope. Therefore the whole War on Drugs is illegal and un-Constitutional. We needed a Constitutional amendment to ban liquor. After the Volstead Act was repealed, no one ever bothered to get a Constitutional amendment to go after drugs. Hence the War on Drugs is, on its face, illegal.

You assume temperamentally I lean socialist. I can see why you assume that. But the reality is: I lean populist. Ways in which I lean populist:

1) I believe that corporations should NOT be allowed to use the government as a sock-puppet to force people to buy their products.
2) I believe that corporations should NOT be allowed to use the government as a sock-puppet to take taxes meant for the public good, which will then be diverted to private companies.
3) I believe that without the working man--and a solid middle class--the United States will collapsed into a Third World South American-style hellhole.
4) I believe that national healthcare SHOULD be considered [*real* national healthcare, not Obamacare]--but only if the people vote on it and ONLY if we have a Constitutional amendment legalizing it.

In short, I want the government to follow the law. No more eminent domain landgrabs (to take private people's land to fork it over to corporations), no more warrantless spying, no more extra-legal assassinations, no more hidden gulags and black sites, no more Presidents ignoring standing laws because they don't personally agree with them.",,0,0,t1_cqusveb

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining
&gt;Redlining is the practice of, in the United States, denying, or charging more for, services such as banking, insurance,[2] access to health care,[3] or even supermarkets,[4] or denying jobs to residents in particular, often racially determined,[5] areas. The term ""redlining"" was coined in the late 1960s by John McKnight, a sociologist and community activist.[6] It refers to the practice of marking a red line on a map to delineate the area where banks would not invest; later the term was applied to discrimination against a particular group of people (usually by race or sex) irrespective of geography.

&gt;During the heyday of redlining, the areas most frequently discriminated against were black inner city neighborhoods. For example, in Atlanta in the 1980s, a Pulitzer Prize-winning series of articles by investigative-reporter Bill Dedman showed that banks would often lend to lower-income whites but not to middle- or upper-income blacks.[7] The use of blacklists is a related mechanism also used by redliners to keep track of groups, areas, and people that the discriminating party feels should be denied business or aid or other transactions. In the academic literature, redlining falls under the broader category of credit rationing.

&gt;Reverse redlining occurs when a lender or insurer targets minority consumers, not to deny them loans or insurance, but rather to charge them more than could be charged to a comparable majority consumer whose business is more sought after.[8][9]",,0,0,t3_34ef1b

Let's do some math. 

SF's minimum wage before Prop J was $10.74 

Source: http://ballotpedia.org/City_of_San_Francisco_Minimum_Wage_Increase_Referred_Measure,_Proposition_J_(November_2014)

$15 - $10.74 = $4.26 = The amount by which the minimum wage will eventually increase.

$80,000 / $4.26 ~ 18,780 = The total number of annual worker-hours the comic shop is using.

18,780 / 52 ~ 360 = Weekly total worker-hours

360 / 40 = 9 = The number of full time-equivalent employees that (the owner is implicitly claiming) this comic shop uses.

Does a comic shop really need 9 full-time employees? Sounds kind of weird, right?

...But wait...

My qualms about nationalized healthcare are not ideological, but procedural. Basically, for all of America's history, we defined an excise tax as a tax on services or products you used. For instance, if you pump gas, you're paying an excise tax on it to help pave roads. If you don't drive, you don't have to pay the tax. There are excise taxes on alcohol, firearms, tobacco, etc.

Those who don't use these products don't have to pay the tax.

Why Obamacare was legally murky was because the Executive Branch was trying to make the case that they can tax people for NOT using a product. This had never been done in US history. The claim had never been made that you can tax people on what they DON'T do.

But more than that: Obamacare was NOT nationalized healthcare in any way, shape or form. It was using government coercion to force people to buy expensive corporate healthcare.

This is corporations using government as a sock-puppet to force people to buy their product. It's corrupt on so many levels. (Ironically, Obama himself called it a corrupt corporate giveaway in his debates with Hillary Clinton."")

I'd be for having REAL nationalized healthcare . . . but only if the laws and procedures are observed. I'd have nothing against the people having a vote on it, and an amendment being added to the Constitution. I think it would pass with flying colors.

So I have no fear of allowing the people to vote.

I just want the rules followed.

When the people signal to the State that it's okay to skirt the procedures, to ignore the law, then we end up with warrantless wairetaps, extra-legal assassinations, black sites and hidden gulags, etc.

The rules are there for a reason: to hem in the arbitrary power of the State. If we equivocate and allow them to slowly make disobeying the law an acceptable thing, we're screwing ourselves in the long run. ""Constitution says that you have to have due process and are allowed to consult with an attorney? Oops! You already allowed us to set the precedent that, if the President doesn't like a law, he can ignore it. So no lawyer for you.

They would start out in the stock room, or pushing a broom, or whatever, and work their way up.  Keep their nose clean for a couple of years, and join the union.  They were set for life.  Buy a house.  Raise some kids.  Put them through college.  And, at the end, retire with a decent pension.  _That_ was the American dream and, for a lot of folks who were generally agreed to be ""not college material,"" it gave them a way to achieve it.

Those days are gone now.  Beginning in the early 1970s, the big factories began to close up, and the jobs moved away: first down south. Then out west. Now, overseas.  Yeah, a few office parks and lighter industrial areas opened up here and there, to take up some of the slack, but people almost needed some sort of training, at least community college, to attain those jobs.  Then, India came beckoning for the clerical jobs, and that was that.

The punchline is that now, as then, not everyone can afford to go to a four-year college, and not everyone who can is able to keep up with college-level studies.  There has to be a way for low-skill people can get a job, work their way up the ladder, and build to a decent future.  

And, in the U.S., there just isn't, anymore.  People start on the bottom, and stay there, filling the holes with plastic, payday loans, and public assistance.  It isn't that the minimum wage is too low, it's that there are not enough ways for people to progress beyond that level.

""In a recent report, David Neumark concluded that “[T]he existing research literature provides no
solid evidence of beneficial distributional e!ects of minimum wages for poor or low-income families
on the whole. As a result, there is no basis for concluding that minimum wages reduce the proportion
of families living in poverty or near poverty” (Neumark 2012). However, a careful look at the existing
research does not seem to support this conclusion. The totality of evidence from the 12 published
studies for which I could obtain or construct minimum wage elasticities point towards some poverty
reduction from minimum wage increases.""

Your studies are based on wildly misinterpreting data.  Most modern economic literature shows that raising the price floor of labor above the equilibrium has far, far more positive effects on the bottom quintile of workers than anyone else, even if they are only moderate.  Which would entail that further increases in min wages may be even more beneficial.

The lowest common denominator of a socialist is someone who wants to redistribute ownership of societies capital assets - the kind of property that makes more property. The idea is that owning capital assets is one of the main sources of power in society. If you're a Marxist, then capital assets (the ""means of production"") are THE most important source of power in society, so much so that all of history can be explained according to who owned the most important assets and what they did with them. So if ownership of capital assets has been spread, then so has power.

As far as I know, this is not what Bernie campaigns for.  

Social democrats, on the other hand, tax the private sector to provide public goods and services. This is more like what Bernie wants.  Strong public goods and services.  But if the market economy isnt healthy, then there isnt any wealth to tax. Social democrats and the welfare state are therefore dependent on the success of the market. Not very socialist, right?

Unfortunately no one has figured out a way to redistribute this power in a way that isnt cripplingly moralistic and, ironically, incredibly authoritarian.

In the 19th century, Social Democrats and Socialist were basically the same people. The split came when European socialists started getting elected between the late 19th century and WWI. These socialists realized they had no idea how to ""redistribute ownership of the means of production"" without falling into the trap explained above, so they latched onto a system designed by snobby aristocrats that was meant to keep socialists from getting elected in the first place. This was Bismarck's system of public insurances that became the prototype of the modern welfare state.

So the socialists that got elected abandoned their whole idea about redistribution capital assets and hoped no one noticed. Most of their working class voters didnt mind, but the die hard socialists sure did. There was a lot of name calling, but in the end, in terms of economic success and a commitment to civil liberties, I think the Social Democrats came out on top.

The thing is, these social democrats kept calling themselves socialists because it kept getting them elected. And in some parts of the world it still does. But what they're really arguing for are healthy market economies they can tax for public goods and services. And just because something is a public good doesn't make it socialist. I mean, we've had public goods and services ever since we invented agriculture. Was everyone from the Egyptians to Louis XVI a socialist? Has the entire history of civilization been the history of socialism?

Confusing the welfare state and social democracy with socialism only helps two types of people. First, it helps western socialists seem successful when they absolutely failed to carry out the defining piece of their grand scheme. Second, **it helps the radical right point to something normal, like public goods and services, and make them seem radical and dangerous.**

I agree. I really do. But what's the end game? That's the perverse electoral system. A central piece of your platform is public funding and a general aversion to PACs. You want to amend campaign finance laws that flood the system with corporate influence. But in order to win, you have to ""buy"" the election. So you win.

And now you're going to amend or eradicate the mechanisms that carried you to victory?

If the Wal-Marts of the world couldn't do that then they wouldn't compete with the small business as well in the first place.  

In a situation where everyone is being impacted equally, such as a minimum wage hike, there isn't this unfairness introduced and so it's not germane to the conversation.  People with more money spend their money more.  If you've ever worked in a food-service situation that has alcohol you've likely heard the phrase ""giving it back to the bar"".  That's when the employees take their paycheck, and turn right back around and spend it at their place of work.  If your employees don't want your own product, you have other issues with your business model than what you are paying them.  Minimum wage hikes do no directly translate to business closures.  This is demonstrable, but hopefully this little anecdotal story helps as well.

Except you're putting that judgment in the hands of someone you don't know instead of at least gathering some actual information yourself.

Aside from that, the impression I'm getting from you is that it's impossible to reasonably figure out what a politician might be like in office and so there's no point in trying. Just look at what they promise, what their platform is, and vote based off of that. If that's what you're saying, I flatly disagree because a better decision would be to look at their voting record. And that does NOT mean have someone else tell you their voting record because I've heard those slanted SO many times. ""He voted to cut off all funding to our troops currently stationed in Iraq"". No, he voted to pull out of the war in Iraq. I made up that example and it's kinda crappy but it's exactly what happens over and over again.

In true capitalism, there is no Too-Big-To-Fail.

There's socialism in America--socialism for Wall Street. If they have losses, those losses are passed on to the people. Where they have gains, contrariwise, they get to keep those.

It's a wonderful scam.

But the thing is: Without an all-powerful State, the corporations couldn't use it to coerce the population.

So I'd like the drain the swamp.

The government must have limited power and authority. It must be largely de-centralized [like how the original Constitutional set-up is].

It's a lot easier for corporations to bribe politicians and affect change if everything is centralized. Centralization is a one-stop shopping place for corruption.

It's a lot harder [and more expensive] to go to 50 states and bribe all the people there at the local level than it is to bribe a handful of people in a central location.

Which is why corruption always lobbies for centralization. 

They want all information and money bottlenecked through a central location--which they can control.

This is my main beef with socialists. They love centralization and state power. Historically, they've been very antagonistic to local autonomy and freedom of choice.

They want one standard--and they want to dictate what that standard is.

Me? I believe in diversity. Diversity of standards based on community differences.

Which is why the Constitution was such an amazing document. It gave massive power to people on the local level, and gave the feds very sparse and limited powers.

The Left crows about how it loves diversity. But, other than skin color, they have a horrible record of believing in diversity. They (in my estimation) don't believe in a diversity of views, a diversity of opinions, a diversity of standards.

They sing the praises of centralization and autocratic control by an ""enlightened elite"".

To me, that set-up is a recipe for corruption.

Which is why every so many socialist states (with very few exceptions) turned into tyrannies with breathtaking rapidity. It's why the majority of the ""socialist utopias"" all throughout the 20th Century degraded into gray hellholes known more for their gulags and mass-murder than for their equality.

In short, centralization = corruption.

Edit:  In case anyone is wondering, Obama was doing better in the polls than Sanders, versus an opponent that was doing worse in the polls than HRC today, had raised more money, and had earned more public endorsements by fellow Democrats (as far as I know Sanders has none whereas HRC is breaking records).  There is literally no argument that Obama had less of a chance during his first run.  Grassroots groundswell is great, but Obama had that to go with the necessary resources and the backing of establishment Democrats who sway opinion within the party, whereas Bernie Sanders only has the first.  I like Sanders politics better than even candidate Obama's politics (as opposed to the even more moderate POTUS Obama's politics) but making false statement just make his supporters seem loony, a narrative that was used against Ron Paul in 2012 in order to push moderate voters away from him.  If supporters of Sanders want his campaign to be taken seriously, we should admit that it will take an historical run in the primary to win and therefor everyone needs to help him for there to be even a chance.  Not that there is anything wrong with being the Ron Paul of the Democrats given that Paul definitely introduced some Libertarian ideas into the mainstream GOP (even if it tends to be lip service), but if you want to see him win please don't make obviously wrong statements when it just makes neutral viewers become turned off from his campaign.",,1430501849,0,t1_cqup0iq

When capital organizes, it's called a corporation. Their job is to extract as much value as possible to distribute to investors and shareholders by driving down production and payroll costs as much as the market will allow. When labor organizes, it's called a union. Their job is to command as high amount of wages and benefits as possible while minimizing the amount of work exploited from them. When these two market forces balance one another out, the result is an equilibrium of efficient production and tidy profits for shareholders in exchange for fair wages and benefits for the labor force that produces that value.

Unfortunately, capital organization is winning. By using the state as a weapon, corporatists have made much headway in using the heavy hand of government to introduce an inorganic force into the labor market and weaken union organization, allowing large firms to drive down payroll costs and benefits even further than they could in a freed market where labor could compete with capital on even ground. In addition, large firms also exploit the social welfare system by paying their labor force low enough to force taxpayers to subsidize workers' income so their workers can bring food to the table and roofs over their heads. Big corporations enjoy having taxpayers foot the bill for them so they don't have to cut into their profits to pay living wages themselves.

Among other suggestions like minimum wage and strengthening labor organization, there are other ways to attack this problem. As implied at the beginning, the competition between capital and labor emerges from the traditional methods in which business entities are structured, with privatized capital ownership exploiting socialized production. Another way of structuring a business is called a ""worker-owned cooperative."" In this type of firm, employees and members collectively own the means of production within the entity - traditional private ownership is abolished. Corporate governance is structured using various methods of self-management (the [Policy Governance Model](http://www.carvergovernance.com/model.htm) is popular), production is democratized, and profits are distributed in a more even fashion according to living wage principles espoused by many co-op organizations. These firms compete with other firms in a free market economy without state interference into the organization itself. If more firms structured themselves this way and distributed profits according to living wage principles as most co-ops do, it would alleviate the need for - or at least, reduce the reliance upon - other methods of social assistance or minimum wage jockeying.

[Worker cooperatives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative) are part of an economic philosophy called [market socialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism) and is under the big tent of [left-wing libertarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism) philosophies. The [NCEO](https://www.nceo.org/articles/employee-ownership-100) has a rather comprehensive list of firms using the ESOP model, which is apparently favored by supermarkets. As it happens, [Bernie](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/worker-owned-businesses-2014) is a supporter of legislation making it easier for individuals to work together to create worker cooperatives and has supported legislation in Vermont to do just that.

The bill was also championed by Wall St agents within the Dem party. The role of Rubin especially was critical.  Just note the key beneficiary of this was CITI group, which the law permitted to be formed. Rubin was named their chairman practically the moment he stepped down from government. 

Summers is Rubin's chief protege. Just as much of a Wall St whore as his mentor.

I find this really interesting because Mosby's parents were (are?) both cops, as well as a grandparent and several aunts and uncles. You'd think the FOP would figure that, on top of the fact that prosecutors usually side with police, she would be favorable to the police because she has so many family members who are/have been cops.

In their open letter about this, they cite her relationship (not specified) with the Gray family's lawyer and the relationship (not specified) between several of her prosecutors and members of the media. Those reasons seem fairly flimsy to me. The Gray family's lawyer might help them sue the city in a civil procedure, but Mosby is concerned with criminal law. And what has a relationship with the media got to do with anything? The FOP will have its contacts in the media, too.

It's on a watchlist that includes the Red Cross and the Sierra Club, two organizations that I am 100% certain are on the up-and-up (especially because I worked with the latter back in the day).

It says the Clinton Foundation is on the watch list for:

&gt; In its justification for placing the Clinton Foundation on its watch list, Charity Navigator cited numerous recent articles concerning donations from foreign governments.

&gt;It cited a Feb. 19, Wall Street Journal report claiming “at least 60 companies that lobbied the State Department during [Hillary Clinton’s] tenure donated a total of more than $26 million to the Clinton Foundation.”

So? That's not anything ""wrong"", it may ""smell bad"" because she was Secretary of State. But I seriously doubt that while she was Secretary of State she had any say over the donors of the charity (I'm guessing she was fairly busy). IF there were evidence donations to the Clinton Foundation influenced her decisions of Secretary of State, that would be one thing (and if proven true, would absolutely be a ""she should go to jail"" type thing), but there's not evidence of such activities.

The other stuff listed is either conjecture / opinion, so I don't give it too much weight. 

---------------

It's possible the foundation stuff is a BIG DEAL if in fact she was allowing foreign governments to influence US foreign policy through personal donations to her group. However, until there's more evidence than mere speculation, I'm going to assume it's spin by a reporter who doesn't like her (I went through and looked at the articles he's published on DailyCaller, about one in ten is a Clinton story and literally every one is negative).",,0,0,t1_cquylyc

You quoted exactly what I was talking about. It proves me to be correct. As I explained to digital_end, there is no reasonable way to interpret what is in the platform other than that the Democratic party supports elective late term abortions and is in favor of government funding for said abortions. Debbie Wasserman Schultz affirmed her support for the official Democrat position of legal elective late term abortion in her angry response to Rand Paul a few weeks ago. She is the leader of the DNC!  

It takes a great deal of dishonesty, or ignorance, to actually claim that the Democratic party is *not* in favor of legal elective late term abortions as per their official platform. If you really think that I'm just ""spouting nonsense"" then I feel sorry for you. 

My emphasis added: 

&gt;The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman’s right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy, including a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay. **We oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right.** Abortion is an intensely personal decision between a woman, her family, her doctor, and her clergy; **there is no place for politicians or government to get in the way**. We also recognize that health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions. We strongly and unequivocally support a woman’s decision to have a child by providing affordable health care and ensuring the availability of and access to programs that help women during pregnancy and after the birth of a child, including caring adoption programs.

Even if the officer in Ferguson was completely respectful the entire time and only shot because he feared for his life, the fact that so many of Ferguson's citizens got out and protested for days means that they did not see this as a one-off incident that would be handled promptly and justly. It means that they are accustomed to being treated badly by their police, with nothing done about it, and that they expected the same thing to happen again. 

Demonstrating cannot be fun. Few bathrooms, you have to stand in crowds, nothing to do but chant. The demonstrators staged protests because they were tired of their police treating them badly. The ""legal fact"" that the shooting was justified does not change the actual fact that the people of Ferguson have reasons not to trust their police.

In Baltimore, it was similar. It seems as if these officers were culpable, although the courts have not decided that yet. But the fact that the people of Baltimore immediately turned out to protest means that they had seen too many injustices committed by police, without anything being done to make it right. In this case, if the charges are correct, this ongoing culture of disrespect for the citizens of Baltimore lead to a man's death.

So the larger problem in both cities, and probably a lot more, is that cops continually violate people's rights, and continually get away with it. That has to stop. Baltimore is setting a good example by at least filing charges.",,0,0,t1_cqv68c1

This is the problem with trickle down economics. The government still holds a monopoly over certain markets.

You got that right!  I have die-hard Republican in-laws and talking to them is really just hearing the same soundbites. Same thing here on reddit - the republicans all parrot the same soundbites. 
Having a rational conversation is impossible because if you dispute what they say and have data, they just repeat the talking point - like that's all you need.

And that's what is troubling, there isn't any real thought.  BS will be said on Talk radio and it's immediately taken to be the truth.  For example, even though several studies have shown that the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 had nothing to do with the financial meltdown, most republicans will stick to the BS that that law forced banks to lend to people who couldn't pay - which is also completely wrong.  From what I can find, that lie was started by Sean Hannity on his radio show.

If regulations were enforced and others weren't repealed, the mess wouldn't have happened. the *lack* of government regulation caused the meltdown but Republicans will continually parrot the ""fact"" the government regulations are ""bad"".

Secondly, he's trying to diffuse and rebut any support gay rights proponents get from the psychological community by claiming that the community is defending pedophilia and that their research is suspect.

But I definitely have to disagree. For example, why is a bad thing that labor costs are reduced? You are able to produce more capital cheaper and more efficient which means consumers get their products for a cheaper price as well.

That said, there is an issue with unskilled labor not having positions. So that leaves two options: Work for a lower wage (which wouldn't necessarily be an issue in the future so long as wages rise even just slightly and prices of goods and services stay stagnant or regress) OR we as a society can continue to help them develop skills through education (community college, night classes, skill development programs, ect). 

In the 1800's we barely had any automation yet we didn't even come close to full employment now did we?

Satanists do not worship Satan. They are adherents that the individual and logic is highest being. They chose an intentionally inflammatory name to people who self identify as Christians. 

They then persue logical, limited government type policies. The religious people can't side with them because of the name and this forces the religious people to argue illogical points.

Deregulation began in earnest with Reagan, before that Nixon removed the direct convertibility of the US dollar to gold, and Clinton really nailed on the lid to the coffin that contains the American Middle Class by pushing through NAFTA and passing the Graham - Leach - Bliley Act.  Those last two were pretty crucial to the destruction of the economy - the so called Free Trade Agreement led to a net loss of 700k jobs as companies moved manufacturing overseas, and the GLBA let financial institutions operate as investment banks and commercial banks at the same time, and we ended up with enormous system risk based on the subsequent bad decisions that were made by financial institutions - the so called Too Big to Fail.  

Bush cut taxes on the wealthy, which not only was a bone to throw to his wealthy backers but also was a part of the Republican plan of ""Starving the Beast"" - cut taxes, manufacture a budget crisis, then trim social welfare programs to ""solve"" the crisis.  He also started two extremely costly wars which ended up putting strain on the government finances and quickly eliminating the budget surpluses that Clinton left him with when he left office.  

It's definitely not solely Bush's fault, and probably not even primarily his fault.

&gt; For example, from the past decade we know that trickle down economics don't work. From the past decade we know that having strong regulations to keep the big banks in check is better than removing regulations and letting banks do whatever they want.

Not even remotely true. If you actually paid attention in history class, it was the Reaganomics [that brought the country out of the horrible stagflation that happened under Jimmy Carter's watch.](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/Reaganomics.html). In modern history, Estonia is one of the [fastest growing economies after the 08 crash due entirely to low taxes and low spending](http://www.newsmax.com/Rahn/estonia-freemarket-economy/2011/06/21/id/400766/).

&gt;From the past decade we know that strengthening the middle class by raising the minimum wage results in positive changes for everyone - even employers.

lol wut? Any sources on that? I can understand if the minimum wage keeps up with inflation but raising it? it generally doesn't help. [When looking at european countries with and without minimum wage, countries without minimum wage saw much higher employment rates and better paid workers](http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/24/report-minimum-wage-has-hurt-employment-in-europe/). 

&gt;Like free post secondary education that has proven successful in other countries like Sweden and Norway. A well educated population is good for everyone - especially employers

Look at one of my last posted articles. Sweden and Denmark have private school vouchers (something US republicans want). Swedish Students also graduate with about $19,000 of debt (only 30% less than US Students) and 85% of students graduate with debt.

I am a toolbox. I do not limit myself to only using a hammer. Different situations call for different tools. A planned market economy works in some places, a free market works in others. Class causes some problems, but not all problems.

The two groups look at the issue in a different way. I don't care the politics of the city. People in power in either party can, and do abuse power. So this isn't about party politics but about perception of real issues.

Conservatives blow off those who have regular problems and side with those in government and stand up for them (unless, of course, it's that one guy in Office, Obama). They blame the victims of government power abuse and incompetence.

Liberals tend to see the issue as something that is fundamentally wrong with the system and how it works, while also saying if someone did something wrong they should be held accountable. But many aren't because they aren't poor, minority, etc. 

I would think the right would care about unequal justice and abuse of the system against the citizens. But they keep proving me wrong by siding against the people they don't like and patting those doing the abuse on the back.

* Withdrawal from costly, pointless wars against *fucking assholes* in the middle east (not my country, not my problem, that's what I say).
* A balanced economic system and tax code that enables the rich to stay rich, and the poor to get richer.
* Trade deals that keep jobs in America, not forcing American workers to compete with slave labor in other countries.
* A responsible and prudent plan for energy independence and to combat climate change (we are talking about trying to avoid an apocalypse here!).

- I don't agree with his energy policy. He supports a ""no new nuclear"" policy, and a ""perfect world"" renewable-only plan starting immediately. 

* He supports a carbon tax. I'm all for fighting against climate change, but making it more expensive is not the way to do it.

* He supports forced union membership and union bullying tactics, but not classifying unions as political organizations or limiting their political contributions even if Citizens United is overturned (which, to be fair, I believe it should be).

* He uses ""tax the rich more"" class warfare as the sole solution to any financial qualms about any of his plans, even if the numbers don't add up.

* He's fallen in line with most Democrats on gun control. (which disappoints me, since he used to be pro-2nd-amendment).


On the flip side, a few things I DO agree with him on:

* Wants to reform the election system, and publicly fund national elections. I wish more senators were in line with this one. Getting money out of politics should be the #1 political agenda right now, since it's the only way #2, #3, and so on are ever going to get done.

* I realize this makes me a traitor, but I'm in full support of a single payer health care system. The numbers just don't lie on this one, and it's proven to be the most efficient way to deliver health services, and every argument that my ""side"" tends to make against it is easily dismissed.

Yes? I never said it would cause the destruction of man kind? But it's way above optimal, still. Just because some of the effects don't make headlines doesn't mean they're not there. For that matter, states with the *lowest* minimum wage are also doing ""fine"", whatever fine means.

&gt;EITC, ah, in other words more corporate welfare. Let business pay lower by paying their employees through the public coffers. This is crazy, admitting there is a problem with the low pay of businesses but giving them a pass by paying their employees a little extra. THAT'S crazy economic policy when you think that's better than just saying you need to pay your employees that much.

If your goal is to help the poor, it's better done through the EITC, full stop. I agree, if all you care about is hurting corporations, it might not be the best policy. But if your main policy goal is to hurt corporations instead of helping the poor, I don't think that's a very empathetic goal.

&gt;istorically, during the Industrial revolution we did just the opposite. What happened? We, and other countries not participating in free trade, flourished anyways. During the 1970s, we opened things up a bit more. What happened? Nothing good economically.

Cause and effect is not that direct.

&gt;But hey, don't let facts, reality, or history get in the way of your theory.

Again, this is economic consensus at this point. ""Theory"" just like climate change is a ""theory"". I'm sorry, but saying that things are good in the 50's and not good in the 70's isn't a hill of beans compared to the research that's been done.

I think that the officers deserve to be prosecuted for what they did, and it was completely illegal for them to arrest him.

However I want to point out that he initially ran from police, which the [supreme court ruled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_v._Wardlow) is probable cause _for detaining, questioning, and frisking a suspect_. It is **not** grounds for arresting someone. I just wanted people to clear that legally the police had reason to stop him, _but not to arrest him_.

Oh, here I was thinking you had never seen a dollar.  The question is, do you want *more*?  You really seem to have a tenuous grasp on how the economy works.  Whether you have to give a portion of your money to poor people or not, this ""bailout"" you speak of, it is in your best interest that those people not be impoverished in the first place -- but more importantly, it is in your best interest that they are given an opportunity to make their poverty not permanent.  It is *not* cheaper to not bail people out, because *not* bailing them out does serious damage to the economy you live in.  You see?  The money you lose by worsening your economy enacting a policy that casts millions into poverty is more money lost than the money you spend on this ""bail out"".  This is not a complicated idea.

A lot of what we're seeing in policing goes straight to the Supreme Court rulings from the last 30 years. There's no way to argue that it's been anything other than conservative justices paving the way for the expansive police protections that have caused these problems.

Just like teachers in red states tend to be relatively liberal compared to the community, so are LEOs relatively conservative in blue states/cities. This isn't an exclusively conservative problem, but it's definitely a stretch to say that you can't blame Republicans for what's happening around the nation.

More liberal court decisions and more liberal politicians *will* make a difference. Having heard some recent SC debates on policing, it's very obvious where the partisan lines are drawn on how much leeway we should grant to police.

1430504811,1,t5_2cneq,t3_33zcwn,t1_cqv9fvu,0,,,politics,cqv9fvu,,0,0,0,dlp211,1,1432717053,"Generally this is all correct, but this isn't the scenario I described so here it is again in list form.

1. Person A invest 100k in a capital asset.
2. Asset appreciates to 1MM
3. Person A dies and bequeaths their estate (valued at 6.4MM) to Person B
4. Unrealized Capital gains not paid on the asset - 225k

Scenario 1 - No Estate Tax

1. All 6.4MM goes directly to Person B and resets the invested at amounts.
2. Asset appreciates from 1MM to 1.3MM
3. Person B sells asset, only pays capital gains on 300k because the ""invested"" amount resets when it passes through the estate and 900k of appreciation goes untaxed.
4. Sells all other assets (assume no appreciation) 5.4MM
5. Total taxes paid - 75k (assume 25% cap gains tax)

Scenario 2 - Approximation of todays Estate Tax

1. Estate pays 40% on 1MM (5.4MM still tax free), Person B inherits 6MM
2. Person B sold 400k of the asset to pay the tax
3. Asset appreciates 30% (same as above) now worth 780K
4. Sells remaining asset and pays capital gains on 180k.
5. Sells all other assets (assume no appreciation)
6. Total taxes paid - 45k + 400k = 445k (assumes 25% capital gains)

So this is one of the things that the estate tax is meant to handle, that is, unrealized capital gains.  Now you can argue that assets shouldn't be taxed until sold, but this actually causes a lot of problems since we should allow smaller estates (5.4MM/10.8MM) to pass tax free and reset the invested at amount.  But this would force us to either declare certain assets as tax exempt, or for the government to collect the appropriate taxes upon the sale of all assets until the tax bill is satisfied.  Neither of these are better, and would be difficult to enforce.

Family farms are easily protected through rules that exist for farms, or by simply incorporating the farm (and at a value in excess of 5.4MM/10.8MM they absolutely should be incorporated, that just smart business).  

Spouses are not subject to the estate tax since assets are (generally) considered to be joint owned by married couples, so this isn't a problem either.

The estate tax is not a good solution, but it is the best solution to combat various tax avoidances and social problems that come from the mass accumulation of wealth. It ensures that the next generation has the opportunity at purchasing and developing assets that are scarce like property, stock, etc.

These laws were drafted with vague language referencing ""religious freedom"" without citing one specific religion but the intent is pretty clear. Obviously the laws were meant only to benefit the primary religion of the Bible Belt.

The Satantic Temple is using their own logic against them to show that if they truly want religious freedom that means the freedom of ALL religions, not just Christianity.

This puts those lawmakers in an awkward position. They'll either have to tolerate groups with the exactly opposite agenda that they have citing the RFRA law or admit that it was only intended to insulate discriminatory practices from criticism or repercussion by hiding it behind the banner or ""religious freedom.""

I think he's an important and necessary figure in the senate and would be more useful there. I guess I really admire him for the issues he cares about, but I haven't seen any of them come to fruition which makes me ambivalent about his effectiveness as a president.

With Hillary, she's got the experience and cunning, but that's also why I don't trust her. I don't want her to be president, but I think she has a better chance at it.

Bernie could have a real shot as a populist candidate, but he's got to do something to show both his charisma and suitability for the office. I think President Obama's 2008 success was largely due to his ability to convince people that he was not only genuine about what he wanted for the nation, but also his ability to inspire people to think those things could really happen. He made it seem like it wouldn't be politics as usual -- and unfortunately, he wasn't as much of a maverick as people thought he was and it led to a lot of dismay and disenchantment to politics among younger voters soon after. 

Now, Bernie has to work with that and somehow reengage those voters. One thing he's got going is that people are sick of the deadlock and partisan politics in congress and he would be more or less of an independent in that regard.

That mayor’s 4 year term is the only interruption in Democrat rule since 1947. They have had Democrat control for 64 of the last 68 years, and sole control for the last 48 years straight.
Their mayor is black. Their previous mayor, Sheila Dixon, was black. She was convicted of embezzlement in 2010 and couldn’t finish her term. They had a white mayor (current Democratic Presidential hopeful Martin O’Malley) for eight years. The mayor before him was black.
Their City Council consists of 15 members. All fifteen are Democrats. The Council President is black. Democrats have had control of legislation in Baltimore for the last 50 years. Every program, policy, initiative, or school curriculum that exists in Baltimore was enacted by liberal Democrats.
The Police Commissioner is black. Approximately 50% of the police force is black.
The School Superintendent is black, along with the School Board. The district has an annual budget of $1.32 billion to teach 84,000 kids. The Baltimore school system ranks second among the nation’s 100 largest school districts in how much it spent per pupil at $15,700 per student. Only NYC spends more. Only two thirds of students graduate high school, despite this high level of spending.
The average SAT scores of Baltimore City public school students are: 379 in Reading; 376 in Math; 381 in Writing. These are the scores of the best of the best in Baltimore schools who actually think they should get into college. The average scores in the country, which still suck, are around 500. Students with these scores have about a 15% chance of graduating college. This is the ROI you get after spending $188,000 per student over their 12 year academic career.
The population of Baltimore is 623,000 and 63% are black. Median household income is $41,000, with 24% living below the poverty line. The home ownership rate is 48%. The percentage of college graduates is 27%.
The population was 950,000 in 1950, so it has fallen by 35% in the last 65 years. The population was 24% black in 1950. Decades of liberal Democrat policies drove most of the white population out of the city.
Baltimore’s violent crime rate is 370% higher than the U.S. rate. They have over 200 murders, 300 rapes, 3,600 robberies, 4,600 assaults, 7,800 burglaries, and 22,000 thefts per year. These are all 2 to 4 times the U.S. averages per 100,000 people.
Over 35% of all Baltimore residents get food stamps. Over 85% of the kids get free breakfasts and lunches at school. More than 60% of Baltimore residents are receiving some form of government assistance.
Baltimore’s welfare paradise is paid for by outrageously high taxes. It’s income tax rate of 3.2% is on top of the state rate of 4.75%. It’s property tax rate is more than double the other counties in Maryland. The sales tax rate is 6%. Corporations pay an income tax rate of 8.25%.
The percentage of out of wedlock births to black women in Baltimore exceeds 72%. Baltimore and Detroit are the two cities with populations over 600,000 with the highest percentage of single parent households – 59% to 61%.
The reported unemployment rate for Baltimore is 8.2%, one of the highest in the country. In reality, 42% of the working age population is not working. Young black men between the ages of 20 and 24 have a reported unemployment rate of 37%. But in reality, it is north of 60%. The number of employees in 1990 totaled 475,000.

There's a paper by Dube, a minimum wage proponent who suggests a minimum wage for various states/locales. That's probably an upper limit, and he doesn't get anywhere close to $15.

But I'll bite, what papers have you seen suggesting a $15 minimum wage?

&gt;Again, groundless and baseless. Straight up wrong given our current economic situation. Corporations aren't struggling at large in the current climate, profits are high relatively for the large majority. Giving more corporate welfare means the money to pay their employees comes in part from all other people, or away from other needs / public services.
What EITC does at best, is keep around businesses that already are failing. Businesses that can't profit enough to pay their employees decently. In other words, it's a government program to prop up bad businesses, is the end effect instead of just making them pay more.

You called it groundless and baseless and did not even respond to my point. I don't care about corporations. I care about the poor. Again, it seems like you only care about hurting corporations, not about helping the poor. In which case our ideals are not the same.

&gt;Is that your reason for ignoring everything?

It's my reason for ignoring a post hoc ergo propter hoc style argument that has no econometric basis.

&gt;make up all kinds of excuses to not look at reality, real world data, 

Let's look at that actually. But look it up in a peer reviewed journal, not in your adhoc method of doing so.

&gt;Not really. And no, economic theory is not at all close to scientific theory realm of things. Nice try though, economics is not a hard science.

Neither is modeling the climate. Is it your claim you've managed to disprove free trade benefits in a two paragraph post? Why not go out and publish that in a peer reviewed journal?

I rarely hear conservatives even willing to look at systemic causes of problems, the only exception is if they think that ""government"" is somehow involved, and their solution isn't to tweak the government interaction; it is to eliminate it.

For example, if you have an intersection where there are a ton of accidents, conservatives see this as a moral failure, that people aren't driving the way they are supposed to. Liberals look at the intersection and say ""hey, maybe this is dangerous, maybe we can improve it a bit"" - and then conservatives scream ""big government! stop taking away my freedoms or spending my tax dollars on a problem that is due to a lack of personal responsibility of the people getting into accidents!""

And BOTH states are essentially stupidly ignoring reality or expecting magic to swoop in and save the day.  Illinois is doing their best to persuade themselves and everyone else that the investment returns on their pensions will be far higher than ever has been sustained long-term before.  And Kansas... oh boy... poor Kansas... is pursuing this queer fantasy that lowering taxes somehow raises revenue.

It's a practice called ""rough ride"".  EDIT:  It's why the guy is being charged with Manslaughter by Vehicle (i.e. killed him with the cop car itself). 

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/us/freddie-grays-injury-and-the-police-rough-ride.html?_r=0

In Baltimore, they call it a “rough ride.” In Philadelphia, they had another name for it that hints at the age of the practice — a “nickel ride,” a reference to old-time amusement park rides that cost five cents. Other cities called them joy rides.

The slang terms mask a dark tradition of police misconduct in which suspects, seated or lying face down and in handcuffs in the back of a police wagon, are jolted and battered by an intentionally rough and bumpy ride that can do as much damage as a police baton without an officer having to administer a blow.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_ride_%28police_practice%29

Baltimore lawyer Phil Federico described the practice as ""definitely intentional"", saying ""they're unbelted, the inside of these wagons are not padded, they can't protect themselves, and they get thrown from one side to the other, usually landing on their head, and fracturing their neck.""[2] University of South Carolina professor Geoffrey Alpert, an expert in police use of force, has asserted that the practice was common in the 1980s and 1990s, but has become less so with the increased presence of video recording equipment in police vehicles.[1] There are no reliable records of the frequency of these incidents.[5][7]",,1430507938,0,t1_cqv8999

From a pragmatic standpoint, why does it matter?  By not taking PAC money, he's not going to change any policy or give himself a chance to be in a position to make improvements.  I guess for the short term until he runs out of money, which will be soon, he can try to shame other candidates who are taking PAC money, but I question if it's going to even make the slightest difference.  If he wanted to push the party further to the left, he should want to stay in the race for a long as possible, and one needs money to do so.

&gt; If Clinton does unravel you can bet the democrats will demand Warren run.

A few of them will.  But many will question her ability to win the general and will go with a more moderate candidate.  

Also, comparing Sanders with Bill Clinton is a bit of a stretch.  Clinton had some help it's true, but he was also excellent at positioning himself for success, which is the polar opposite from Sanders policy based stances.

The problem of an aggressive militarized police force has nothing to do with republicans v democrats.  

the fact that the court system routinely protects the police is because they share a common working relationship.  they do not share this same relationship with the inner city poor who they never interact with except through the wheels of the justice system.  By its very nature this creates an alliance between the police and the court system.  

the desire to protect your ""own"" is a very human tribal concept ingrained in humans through the evolutionary process.  This is the  ""natural"" way humans organize.  That also means we have to be proactive about preventing this type of behavior because if left unchecked it can and will lead to an ""us vs them"" mentality.  

Look at most police forces anywhere on earth and you will see the police and the justice system routinely cover for each other.

So what? Is Dube god or something? And so is being below optimal crazy? Where is this crazy part aspect, pretending that optimal is going to be a static number?

&gt; But I'll bite, what papers have you seen suggesting a $15 minimum wage?

Nice dishonest deflection. You said it was way above optimal, you made the claim. I asked YOU to back it up. Why did you say it was above optimal? Because a paper you read said it once? I'm going to say you don't even believe said paper, likely, since you refer to him as somebody outside of your circle.

You're the one calling it crazy. I'm asking you to actually back that up. What is crazy about it? Why are you insisting Australia is crazy?

&gt; You called it groundless and baseless and did not even respond to my point.

You don't have any claims to said point. You made a claim, you provided zero evidence for said claim. Your point was groundless and baseless, get it? This isn't either EITC or not, but EITC in place of higher minimum wage. EITC is just an indirect method of paying employees who get low wages more, by corporate welfare. Or you could implement minimum wage and they'd get paid more. The claims that EITC better helps the poor more over than higher minimum wage, again, baseless claim made by you.

&gt; It's my reason for ignoring a post hoc ergo propter hoc style argument that has no econometric basis.

Must have caused? When did I say that? There was two claims, by the way. First, not having free trade is not disastrous, or in other words, not crazy for certain situations. Second, free trade can have negative consequences or play a role in them. And yes, again, most economists actually admit free trade agreements have played **A ROLE** (see, not sole cause) in wage stagnation. This should be a no-duh, but apparently you haven't bothered you check it since you think there is no econometric basis to have in our history.

But you'd rather ignore that, of course.

&gt; Neither is modeling the climate.

Did you just try and claim climate science is not a hard science? You're wrong, did you get that one from Ted Cruz? You want to know what happens when a model doesn't reflect reality? They fix the model, not stick to their guns.

One situation is utterly tragic where an innocent man lost his life; the other situation the one who died was the aggressor.

You're acting as though the wage gap is a defined rule, that all women must be paid $0.77 per $1 a man makes. That's not what's going on here, nor is it what even the shrillest feminist has ever claimed.

This is a social issue; the wage gap is something that emerges as women embark on careers and attempt to rise up in businesses. It comes about for many reasons, some of which equal pay laws address, and some of which they do not. Part of the wage gap is caused by beliefs about how women perform in the workplace at certain jobs--for example, that women are worse at math and science than men. These societal biases can cause some (note: not all) male bosses at some (please note again: not all, or even most) companies to invest more time and give more attention to male employees.

Another big factor for some jobs is maternity/paternity leave policies in America. Oddly enough, Republicans object to addressing that, too.


Oh and FYI, at a $60,000, 6.6% less is a $4,000 difference. And more importantly, that 6.6% difference IS statistically significant, not ""almost vanishing,"" and once again, it's an average.

Btw, note of caution on assessing parties&amp;politicians based on votes. 

The people that run the show are clever enough to maintain an illusion of choice, democracy, and dissent. When a lawmaker's vote is not needed (law will pass or fail anyways) they are then permitted to vote in a way that panders to their constituents (or supporter base) wishes and ideology. However, on those occasions when the corrupt party leadership really needs to get business done for their key backers, like Wall St, they can and do twist arms and play hardball to bring their members to heel.

So, keep in mind some votes are ""gimmes."" It's actually harder than just looking at how someone voted to figure out how good or bad someone is. Were they bucking the party leadership's wishes?  Just pandering to their base cause they could?  Etc.",,0,0,t1_cqv64ro

There were ~30 people who received thyroid doses greater than the occupational safety limit, but this represents a very small increase in any rsik., and those were all radiation workers, and this was due to I-131 exposure on site. I-131 has a half life of 8 days, and so was removed from the environment after ~80 days. There were no deaths due to Acute Radiation Syndrome among anyone in the area.

It was calculated that relative risk if people had remained in the area would have represented a ~0.5% lifetime risk increase of thyroid cancer for infants exposed in the area, and an even smaller relative risk increase (a 0.5% lifetime risk increase equaled a 70% relative risk increase for thyroid cancer relative to background) for other cancers to exposed infants. Thyroid cancer is one of the most treatable cancers and with appropriate screenings for those in the affected areas should have a 0% mortality.

All estimates were made using the no-threshold model, which we use because it overestimates risk. There is no good data on negative effects due to low-dose radiation, and the only long-term studies we have support radiation-induced hormesis, where it would actually be beneficial. But, *all* of those studies lack large amounts of data. 

There has been no significant increase in childhood cancers in the area. The BEIR VII committee (long-term committee studying cancer risk and mortality from atom bomb survivors) determined that there is an excess cancer risk of 10.8% per sievert and excess cancer mortality rate of 5.4% (again, these are long-term studies; BEIR VII met in 2006). Based on the doses there is less than a 1% risk of those exposed getting cancer relative to the general population, and less than a 0.5% risk of those exposed dying due to cancer. 

The latency period for leukemias are ~3-7 years, so if those are to arise we would see these around now. Right now the primary malignancy observed in those exposed has been Thyroid cancer (due to aggressive screening), which is due to the initial I-131 exposure, and is 100% treatable when detected early (and 94% if detected later). The latency period for most solid tumors to arise is in excess of 60 years, and it is likely we will have improved methods to treat those cancers most likely to arise (which is primarily thyroid, and possibly some internal malignancies due to Cs-137 exposure).

The other major radionuclide released that represents a radiation safety hazard is Cs-137, which is a low-energy emitter. It does have a half life of 30 years, so at maximum the area would need to be cleared for 300 years before it was pretty much entirely removed--this is a long time, but not forever. Additionally, this time may be reduced because the energy release is quite low and exposure would not be very high. Additionally, Cs-137 decontamination upon ingestion is quite easy as it can be removed using Prussian Blue, so the main issue would be identifying contaminated food before or after ingestion (skin dose would be low and have low penetration). 

Long-term radiation effects are actually very well-studied and are a major, major concern for the international radiation community. There is very good data that gives us a good idea of what to expect in these situations and what methods are appropriate to handle them. Moreover, the biggest issue with the Fukushima plant that led to its containment failure was lack of upkeep and failure to adhere to regulations and maintenance.

Raising the minimum wage doesn't solve the long term problem, no. But it does start reminding people that no matter what your station in life you still need enough to live on.

But it isn't the satanists who are tied to the stake.  It's women and girls.  More bombings, more beatings, more clinic shutdowns more irrational laws in response.

If ads don't help people get elected, then why do campaigns continue to spend more and more money on ads? Lets look at it a different way, in the free market companies like Coke, Apple, McDonalds, the entire pharma industry, etc. spend huge sums of money on advertising. These companies clearly see advertising as a way to influence behavior and achieve the results they desire, why would an election be different?

Secondly, you talk about how the ""ground game"" actually determines the election. Where do you think the money for the ground game and organization comes from (hint: donors).

Also, nice try with the slight-of-hand on the 2012 election spending. The Mother Jones article you reference goes into great detail on how much the Koch's spent on the election.

If the election comes down to Jeb vs Hillary I definitely won't vote for bush, but I might also just vote third party i see no reason to vote for Hillary.

You can pay this off with about 18 hours/week at minimum wage if you attend/work part time.  If you fund this with school loans the interest amount is extremely affordable at about $1400/year for the $30K you'll owe after graduation.

First off, to make things clear (this part is actually what I believe) X amount of dollars =/= x amount of votes. To place restrictions on how much one entity can donate resting only on the arguement that the sheer amount of money will alter people's vote is ridiculous. It implies that anyone of legal voting qualifications is gullible enough to vote purely on what they see and hear on TV and the radio, which we are not (for the most part). If your opinion can be changed based on a TV ad, then your mind was not made up, and you did not want to put in the effort to inform yourself of each candidate's position. It cheapens the concept of individual freedom into a marketplace. We cannot allow that to have a legal prescendence.
 
Secondly, the IRS and the FEC already have a set of rules and regulations that prevent outside (foreign) actors from influencing elections, after that, everything should be free game. If it is an American-based corporation, then they should have the same abilities to donate as much as they want as Joe the Plumber. If an individual can donate funds anonymously through various mediums, then so should everyone else of legal voting age/meet the necessary qualifications.
 
Basically, the only arguement that can be used rests on anti-rich-shaming. Just because a union, person, corporation, etc. has a shitton of money, does not mean they they should be excluded from certain things. Also, if restrictions on campaign finance were to go through Congress, either side will try their absolute hardest to grab any kind of edge on the other side. I personally, disagree with the aspect of anonimity being in donations to political campaigns. You cannot claim free speech without being able to identify yourself. Just as someone cannot be charge for a crime without facing their accussor, one should not be able to exercise their right of speech without being able to prove that they are an American.

That is the issue, though. You would have that we force people to work to get the EITC, but then employers do NOT have a strong minimum requirement for pay. Since there has been increasing percent of people at minimum pay since implementation of EITC, as well as increasing median age of worker at minimum as well as increasing duration of staying at minimum, I can't believe there is not negative pressure for pay... at least with work being required for some of the primary ways of granting benefits.",,0,0,t1_cqv7kj7

I think this is a great idea. I think it's completely unfeasible, but I'd love to live in a world like this. Unfortunately we don't and likely never will so long as human beings are running the show.

That being said, I didn't address that part of the argument because I had no problem with it. This part however:

&gt; The morality / ethics side of it is that if you don't respect your position enough to stand by it, then that position isn't worth anyone else's time either so fuck off.

This is ridiculous. Just because people want to insulate their belief system (something that is extremely subjective and intimate to the person that holds it) doesn't suddenly mean that their opinion is less valid than anyone else's. You have absolutely no obligation to share your beliefs with the rest of the world, nor should you. You have an inherent right to privacy whether or not you agree with it and just because a person is more willing to exercise it than you doesn't mean that their opinion is less valid. At the end of the day, you are the harbinger of your own soul, and by holding others to the same standard that you hold yourself, you're ignoring the wealth of experiences that create the myriad people that make up the fabric of culture and society. Your willingness to contribute to that conversation should have no bearing on your right to be left alone, much less the say you have in our government. And frankly, you cannot reasonably expect anyone to to have that anonymity violated if we live in a world where you can be discriminated against for having those beliefs. Anonymity isn't a band aid, it's triage. It's a rampart put in place to defend the minority from the scorn of the majority. We'd all love to live in a world where every opinion can be treated with the respect that it deserves, but even you resorted to hostility when your opinion was met with scrutiny.",,0,0,t1_cqvanwj

But I think it's somewhat naive to believe that in the age of our technological breakthroughs, our government will not do everything it can to advance its surveillance capabilities in tandem.

It makes sense given the purpose of the government and the effect of surveillance. It's a rather natural progression regardless of how we, as citizens, view it.

The NSA proves that infinite surveillance will be used improperly, but many things in our daily lives prove that a lack of surveillance is inconvenient, problematic, and sometimes deadly. Cops without body cameras, cars without dash cams, the ability for Hillary Clinton's correspondence to go entirely unchecked as Secretary of State.

Surveillance solves a great many problems and introduces a great many new ones. More importantly, as technology progresses, it becomes more and more inevitable.

So yes, there are a lot of people that are for debt creation when it is used for stimulus purposes because it generates wealth and acts as a safe investment vehicle.

A woman should be able to do *whatever the fuck* she wants with her own body without the state (what you Americans usually call ""government"") telling her what she can do with her body. States telling women they cannot get abortions is a far more egregious violation of the civil rights in the Constitution than the federal government changing laws on their end to allow women to do whatever the fuck she wants with her body, even if it somehow violates the separation of powers set out in the Constitution.

A man or a woman should be able to marry *whoever the fuck* they want regardless of the gender of their partner without the state telling them who they can or cannot marry. States telling men women they cannot marry people of the same gender is a far more egregious violation of the civil rights in the Constitution than the federal government changing laws on their end to allow men and women to  marry whoever the fuck they want, even if it somehow violates the separation of powers set out in the Constitution.

&gt;States being able to decide for themselves what is considered legal is more freedom, it's less centralized control, and that's a good thing.

In my view the individual rights set out in the Constitution trump the separation of powers or states' rights any day of the week, month or year. A war was fought over this, and those who thought that states rights should trump civil rights lost decisively.

&gt;Realizing that some (many) issues are too important and too polarizing to leave up to an elite few in Washington is being a friend to freedom.

Except that ""elite few"" are also known as the ""Founding Fathers,"" and they tried to build a liberal (as in ""liberty"") democracy with a robust set of civil individual rights. Allowing states to violate those rights is contrary to what the Founding Fathers would have wanted, it is anti-liberty, it is allowing the state (as in ""government"" and as in ""state in the union"") to quash civil rights over some pathetic turf war with the federal government.

&gt;He's saying it's not up to him and a handful of politicians in DC to decide, and that's the correct position to take.

Actually., Rand Paul is **against** both abortion and gay marriage. He is **against** liberties and civil rights. He simply tries to frame it as a ""states' rights"" issue because gullible people buy into that rhetoric and still think he is a ""libertarian"" despite the fact that he wants to actively deny people liberties.

&gt;It makes no difference how he personally feels about them. 

This is a bad excuse to give someone who shouts ""freedom"" and ""liberty"" from the rooftops, yet is against freedom and liberty for a huge portion of the population a free pass.

Yes. Doesn't mean it's wrong. No offense, but usually when people talk this way, actually citing papers does nothing to persuade them otherwise, so I'd prefer not to waste my time. Virtually every labour economist would agree.


&gt;Second, free trade can have negative consequences or play a role in them.

I think the more realistic fear is that Sanders' narrative catches on, ""forcing"" Clinton to make remarks which damage her in a general election, much the way Romney's primary statements came back to haunt him.

The difference is that there's no liberal version of the Tea Party which acts as ""purists"", trying to force out Democrats who aren't liberal enough, and not *nearly* as much big money bankrolling extreme liberal views and propping up extreme liberal candidates.

I, acting as an agent of the null hypothesis, can just keep saying ""Nope"".

This is basic experimental procedure dude. The null hypothesis wins by default if the positive assertion fails to provide a falsifiable experiment or if their experiment fails.

   Don't get me wrong. I'm not just saying that most socialist states are corrupt and poor representations of socialism. I'm also saying that most alleged Western democracies are corrupt and poor representations of Democracy.

It's just like capitalism degraded into crony-capitalism.

It's a delicate balancing act. You have to weigh freedom versus corruption, convenience versus the People's rights.

Crony-capitalism can only happen with full state participation. The crony-capitalist needs the state to be strong so that it can illegally extract wealth from the citizens [which will then be funneled through to the crony-capitalist class]. 

But the answer is not to get rid of capitalism. Capitalism will always exist. It always has.

People will always trade and barter. If one guy has a silver coin and another guy has a sack of grain; and the one wants the silver coin more than the sack of grain (and, likewise, where the other wants the sack of grain more than the silver coin), they trade. Both parties are happy. Both sides win.

THAT'S capitalism.

Crony-capitalism is where one guy wants a sack of grain and, rather than pay for it himself, he gets a couple of corrupt cops to go and shake down a small business owner in order to extract money from him. The crony-capitalist then takes the ill-gotten gains and buys the sack of grain for himself.

Without the powerful goons, the crony-capitalist is powerless.

I want the goons gone. I want the crony-capitalist powerless and exposed.

No more sock-puppets. No more manipulations from the shadows.

Transparency would end 99% of it overnight. The cleansing disinfectant of light.

When people deal in abstractions--like God, or The State--they act as if it's some impartial, aloof party demanding their money.

It's always a psychological dodge to get people to think that they're not being robbed by individuals. Kind of like when you whack a dog for pooping on the carpet. Psychologists say to whack him with a rolled-up newspaper, because then the animal will associate the beating with the newspaper and not with you.

Likewise, when thieves hide behind abstractions to rob people.

""Oh, no, no, it's not me robbing you. It's this abstraction called 'government'. You'll be much more willing to part with your money if I tell you that it's an abstraction doing it.""

The reality is: The government is composed of people. 

And people can be corrupted. Politician A is more than happy to retire to a consulting position at a Wall Street firm for ten times what he made as a junior congressman--so long as he puts in a rider on a bill to funnel tax money through to Walmart.

Government has been turned into a money laundering business. A front. A clearing house for corrupt interests.

Republics can only exist so long as moral and incorruptible men are at the helm. I think Bernie Sanders fits this bill far more than anyone in the Republican or Democratic parties. He's so antagonistic to the crony-capitalists, so jaded by Wall Street that I think he'd act as a healthy foil to them. And he's so old and set in his ways, it's unlikely that he'll suddenly buckle under and capitulate. The dude's gonna be dead in a couple of years. He doesn't have a need for a lush consulting gig after leaving Congress.

For these reasons, I think he'd be a good choice to act as the People's advocate when dealing with these vultures.

""Inflicting force on a restrained individual to the point of death, if proven, is one of the most egregious misuses of governmental authority there could ever be. Conservatives should not let their respect for law enforcement – or their skepticism for race hustlers such as Al Sharpton who always seem to appear and demand “justice” regardless of the circumstance — obscure a legitimate investigation into the ultimate government overreach.""

On the Walter Scott shooting:  

""His death at the hands of a police officer appears to be entirely unjustified.   

There has been a murder in North Charleston, S.C. The victim was a 50-year-old black man named Walter Scott. The killer was a 33-year-old white police officer named Michael T. Slager. The story, as we know it, is harrowing...    

Quite what justification could possibly be marshaled in defense of this behavior is unclear — to the point at which we might say confidently, “There is none.” Tennessee v. Garner, the Supreme Court case that governs how police officers must treat those who flee, holds that an agent of the state may use lethal force against an escaping suspect only in such cases as he reasonably concludes that the suspect poses “a significant threat of death or serious physical injury” to himself or to another. To watch the Times’ video is to understand that, at the time he was killed, Walter Scott posed no threat to anybody at all. When Slager raises his gun to shoot, Scott is not only a long, long way away from him, but he also seems to be unarmed.""

No one path is ever necessary.

Why do you think China has become so successful? Because China has merged aspects of Communism and Capitalism. They have taken tools from both toolboxes and now have the highest productive output on Earth. Their use of ultimately technocratic principles has taken them from abject poverty to the world's largest economy in a little over half a century.

&gt; Sanders was an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and participated in the historic March on Washington in 1963 as a 22-year-old student at the University of Chicago. ""It was a question for me of just basic justice — the fact that it was not acceptable in America at that point that you had large numbers of African Americans who couldn't vote, who couldn't eat in a restaurant, whose kids were going to segregated schools, who couldn't get hotel accommodations living in segregated housing,"" he told the Burlington Free Press.

Many of those people may be republicans but i think it's more of a cultural and racial issue than a party platform issue.

In hindsight though I don't see how anyone can call that strategy a success.  The republicans (being mostly old and white) will be slower to accept this change but the younger generation (even those who identify as conservatives) have already changed their minds on these issues.  

On the one hand I see this as optimistic since the drug wars are now widely seen as failures.  On the other hand I don't see the economic outcomes getting any better for inner city minorities.  

In fact I think the prediction that 50% of all labor will be replaced buy robots/computers in the next 20 years essentially guarantees permanent unemployment for the vast majority of The unskilled labor force in America.

Also according [the same polling](http://www.people-press.org/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/), Republicans aren't even *as* likely as those with only a high school education (or less) to demonstrate scientific literacy on questions about topics like evolution and climate change.",,0,0,t1_cqv9mx2

We have a bot that combs through all comments and flags certain words that we know are commonly used to abuse other users - racist terms, politically disparaging terms, threats, etc. Those comments are reported for us to manually review.

We also rely on users to report comments that violate the rules so that we can manually review them and approve/remove as necessary.

There are literally thousands of comments made to /r/politics daily and it is impossible to go through them all. Remember, we are volunteers who have real lives outside of reddit. So we rely on these two things to help us keep the subreddit civil.

When we remove a comment, we don't always leave a comment or a warning. For instance, we don't leave comments when we ban a user for a comment - we simply remove the comment and ban and the user will receive a message from us about why they were banned. 

So even though you may not see us actively removing and warning/banning people for incivility, we are doing it. We don't care where you are on the political spectrum. Our rules are enforced as objectively as possible. ",moderator,0,0,t1_cqvd5fh

Because that ""higher level"" is the actual philosophy. Without doing that actual philosophy, nothing has actually been explained. The question (do things act for ends?) hasn't been answered at all. Currently, your answer for why a root absorbs water (or why it's DNA says to) is ""it just does.""

""VERDICT: When it comes to the combination of institutional lobbying, 527 group donations and PAC expenditures, Koch Industries far out-spends Soros’ hedge fund and think tank, $57.4 million to $12.8 million. Most of this money is attributable to lobbying expenditures. 

VERDICT: Soros rules this category, having poured more than $34.2 million into political channels, compared to $4.06 million for the Koch brothers. (Individual contributions to 527's)

VERDICT: Given the difficultly in tracking donations to nonprofits and charitable organizations, it’s almost impossible to quantify whether the Koch brothers or Soros dominate this political realm. That said, both the Kochs and Soros have spent incredible riches in this area with no sign of stopping. ""

But you also have to understand that capital has risen exponentially also! In other words it is almost a crime to compare income inequality of then to now because we have so much more income now versus then! What I mean is we don't really have to worry about sending your child into labor to make end's meet as compared to us in 1900. 

We have smartphones and appliances and cheap clothing. All of this possible through machinery and cutting labor costs. It won't matter how wealthy the top 1% once we all a good enough standard of living. The issue is that we want everyone to have that standard *now* when that just isn't possible.

Its really easy to forget that under a capitalist economy (well, what we and other countries have close to that) is how we came to the ability as a society to never having to send our child into labor. Its great, its beautiful, and free trade will continue to raise us up. Forget trickle-down, free trade is a rising tide. 

One of the best ways to combat income inequality, in the short term, is an unusually libertarian idea... using either (or both) a negative income tax and a universal basic income. I believe both systems can produce better effects at a cheaper cost, and helps low skilled labor find their way back into the labor market without worrying about how they can provide for their family (to a degree).",,0,0,t1_cqvabcb

Lets make it a point to screw up a kid from birth. First we will arrest his dad on drug charges. The drug laws were created initially for very racist motives, and not for any kinda public health motives. Even when that narrative changed how they were used did not. The issue of drug use is an issue of basic freedom. One should be free to do as they wish as long as they do not involve others who do not wish to be involved... So dad gets arrested, leaving mom behind. Or maybe she goes too and grandma raises the kid. 

So poor kids live in the areas they can afford. Ghettos very similar to the ghettos were jews were forced to live. Freedom to move you say? Economics and knowledge are the fence buddy. In that poor area there is violence and really crappy schools. And a huge police presences that injects itself into your life for just walking down the street. So what is it a kid learns... The cops, the people who work for the government, who work for white people, beat up them, their friends, take their parents, and so on...

The kid grows up... but with serious defects. He doesnt feel he belongs to the collective.. and often sees the collective as the enemy. The government destroys his loved ones. He doesnt have an education; he doesnt know there could be a different way. He cant get a job because he was arrested... maybe for drugs. WHO THE FUCK WOULDNT DO DRUGS in the face of all the brutality they see? Who would not want an escape? White people do more drugs than black people; they have the money. The difference? They arent randomly targeted for stop and frisk and other crap. They have a record... cant get a job... 

If blacks commit more crimes (which they do not, they jsut get caught more imo) then it would be because we fucked up their foundation. Expecting a house to stand tall when you build on quicksand is folly; and this is what society does.

You state that you are ""*asking* why that information must be required,"" but then you make an argument that amounts to, ""including that information actually *causes* logical fallacies,"" which comes off not as *asking* why it *should* be required, but as *arguing* that it *shouldn't* be required - does it make sense where I'm coming from there?

More to the point, though - the entire line of reasoning flies in the face of the fact that, when scientific findings or conclusions are presented, *required* disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is a **fucking huge** deal. When *any* important findings are presented so that some decision making body may deliberate over them, this is generally the case.

Whether an individual who suddenly and without provocation flees from identifiable police officers patrolling a high crime area creates reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment for the police to stop him.

Is a person's sudden and unprovoked flight from identifiable police officers, patrolling a high crime area, sufficiently suspicious to justify the officers' stop of that person?


Holding:

In an opinion delivered by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court held in a 5 to 4 decision that the police had reasonable suspicion to justify the stop.

We’re open 10 hours a day at each of the two stores, seven days a week, so you can see that’s really not a tremendous overlap of hours to get all of the labor done that simply can’t be done with only one person in the store who is expected to be, y’know, helping customers find the things they want (or discover things they don’t know they want yet!)

The difference between today’s MW and 2018 is $3.95 /hour.  $3.95 times 190 hours times fifty-two weeks a year equals just over $39,000 then we have to add about another $3,000 for the matching taxes that all employers pay for Social Security and Medicare, so that’s $42,000 more that staff will cost. (not counting the new-this-year California mandated minimum Sick Days, either!)

However, in order to make forty-two thousand dollars, this means I have to sell roughly eighty-four thousand dollars worth of merchandise because the Cost of Goods Sold is (very roughly) half of the income — no one is keeping $3.99 from a $3.99 comic book!

How do you think video recommendations work? Algorithms look at your previous history as well as what videos you liked and disliked and cross reference it with users with a similar profile. Then recommend you videos those people liked, but you haven't seen yet.  

To be fair, I don't think anyone is using this kind of data to try to figure out what kind of preferences certain individuals have. What the NSA does do if they have the data (and really, they probably do) is run querries that are likely to reveal users that are in some sense dangerous.

No. My original statement that was being argued which I responded to was this:

&gt;""There are plenty of jobs out there, we just don't have the skilled labor to fill them""

So I was originally talking about skilled labor this whole time.

&gt;The sad truth is middle-class and lower jobs are being done for less than can be expected of Americans. 

Lower and middle class jobs?  Lol!  Seems most on this subreddit want more lower paying jobs, or for companies to pay employees more than they are actually worth.  That won't help the economy, but a more skilled labor force to fill the positions that are actually in demand would help more.  There is no need to ""create demand"" when there is already so much labor demand that we can't fill because we're graduating with too many liberal arts, history, and accounting degrees.  Wayyyyy too many lawyers too. 

Im not implying the economy is in good shape.  But on the other hand, lets not act like there a ton people with engineering, or other in-demand degrees are all struggling to find jobs. 


&gt;I worked construction and these guys would come to the U.S. on a visa, live with 4 or 5 people, send almost all their money to their families back home, then would move back when their visa ran out. $8 an hour for a couple years can basically get you retired in a country like Mexico. The sad part isn't that they are siphoning money out of the country, it's the fact that they don't even want to bring their families here. I'm sure they know they're getting fucked, but in their country, they can thrive on that tiny bit of money. One guy I knew had a brand new house built in Mexico after working here for 6 months at $8 an hour. 

This is exactly why we need to up our labor force's skills instead of increasing the amount of lower paid jobs.  Our country's labor is *very* expensive relative to the rest of the world and it is inefficient for us to do things that we can easily outsource.  

For some reason, people in this country think outsourcing is evil, meanwhile it enables the goods to be affordable.  If Nike wasn't allowed to outsource to Asia you think a pair of airmax would still be $90?  no if it was 100% made in the usa itd be more like $900.

I don't think any supporters of welfare programs believe it's OK to abuse the system. That is a straw man argument. There are abuse cases, yes.

But you're overlooking one of the chief factors involved in the corruption: the State.

Without that transfer system, without that money-laundering operation, the thieves are powerless.

You want to leave the money laundering operation in place--and in fact give it MORE power.

But you're overlooking one glaring fact: It's been tried.

Those states that claimed to run along socialist principles--and accrued to themselves massive power over the lives of their citizens--ended up killing 250 million of their own people [in democides] in the 20th Century.

Those who say, ""But the State needs MORE power,"" I have one response: Go crack open a history book and read what those socialist utopias did when they were given ultimate power.

Because of history, I'm not a believer in the trustworthiness of the state. I've seen the body-counts.

People are the most free where the states have the least power.

States with massive internal control (and endless red tape) turn into bureaucratic hellholes, with citizens standing in lines for state-rationed toilet paper and government-issue cheese. Go look at the privations and hardships of the former Soviet Union. Or all the Eastern Bloc countries.

Where ""enlightened elites"" run things--and bottleneck all information and power through themselves--you get bogged down systems and bureaucratic dystopian societies.

Less bureaucracy = more freedom

* Footnote: That said, I'm not saying that crony-capitalist Western countries are the way to go either. I want to strike a balance, if possible. More freedom for average people, less intrusive government (which exist solely to rob the citizens and transfer the wealth to cronies). We're still evolving as a society. I think the answer will end up not being one or the other, but a wise mixture of a number of different systems--with one side balanced against the other to achieve a delicate equilibrium. But one thing's for sure: I don't believe in ""communal ownership of property,"" because there's never been an example in history of such systems not being abused by the people running them.",,1430519587,0,t1_cqvdryc

If everyone thinks that he has no chance of winning and therefore resigns themselves to the usual helping of shit sandwiches...that is the EXACT mindset that allows these turds to keep parading themselves out every 4 years with their billions of dollars.

Luckily Reddit doesn't get to decide anything. I do wish people could find a way to plow through their fog of apathy and maybe think ""This might be our chance to get our government back"". Because if it is...and I didn't participate in some way or actively sabotaged that opportunity by my inaction, I'm no better than those who want to turn this country completely into an oligarchy.

Take a chance. Try some hope, Donate...volunteer and most importantly try to get those around you involved. If you don't like Mr. Sanders views, fine. Don't vote for him. Given his years of support for the average working person...I find it hard to believe that most people wouldn't flock to his candidacy.

The reason it only really feels like it  now is because once wages started stagnating, and cost of living started going up, Americans sent their spouse to work to make up the difference (around the 80s you start to see this huge uptick in  households with two earners, now it's almost the norm unless you are in the upper middle class making six figures) and that worked for a bit, then people started working more - you see this uptick in people working multiple jobs, working more hours every year - and now at this point there's not much else we can do to keep up when wages remain stagnant and cost of living goes up.  

The crisis made things worse because companies quit hiring, and investing/borrowing to expand, and banks stopped lending which slows down business and consumer spending.  A strong middle class is the key to a strong economy - we want them to have disposal income and buy new stuff - the more money they have, the more they spend into the economy, which grows the economy - it's a virtuous cycle that can become a vicious cycle if folks can't get good jobs, afford nice things, go to college, or borrow money.

it was a big closer..on both sides of the aisle but still a majority of republicans against a majority of dems..  against defunding the NSA.

(and really this one was kinda stupid.. we want remove the spying on all americans, but I think we still need an NSA.. it just needs real and proper oversight and powers)

Good show. Bravo, sorry I used crazy instead of insane. I guess those aren't close synonyms.

This isn't totally childish behavior that anybody with half a brain sees through, totally.

&gt; Not optimal is exactly what is says, not optimal.

Nobody cares about your opinion on what the optimal point is. Baseless and unfounded. Also note: not being at the optimal point is not insane economic policy, in my mind. Especially since, you know, the ""optimal point"" isn't really so much a point and isn't exactly set in stone. So, what do you have?

&gt; Yes. Doesn't mean it's wrong.

Ah, I see, so you just get to make up claims, through them out with no evidence of backing. And when called out, you put out this nonsense? Give me a break. If you aren't capable or inclined to support your statements, don't make them.

&gt; Virtually every labour economist would agree

Yeah, no. Again, the question isn't does EITC help the poor when no other plans exist, but whether it's a better option than higher minimum wage in regards to the poor since you want that instead. Why exactly do we have to have one or the other in the first place in your argument anyways? We already have both, we're basically talking would increasing one or the other be better. You don't even seem to get that though.

&gt; I agree... So can the minimum wage, so can every policy.

Ah, so when I point it out clearly, now you agree, eh? What happened to that I was making all these fallacies and what not?

I also like how you outright ignored the first point. Which in part was the most relevant. Because remember, not supported free trade is ~~crazy~~ insane right? Well, except in some situations as our past shows... By the way, that the benefits outweigh the negatives is not clear for us, so net benefit it may not be.

&gt; Which is exactly what economists do.

Actually, the Austrian school of economics doesn't. Which is a prevalent body of economics in this country, which reject real world analysis. But, hey, surely you don't have anything in common with them, and you didn't start this out with claiming opposing views as insane.

&gt; Do you agree that the benefits outweigh the costs

No. Why would I, exactly? Because you CLAIM everybody and their dogs supports it? Yeah, sure.",,0,0,t1_cqvcldc

Information is power, and in a totally neutral sense, the more information you have, the more problems you can solve, including problems for citizens.

The problem is, of course, that information is never used from a purely neutral perspective. However, if we admit that that's the direction technology will take us, we have some time to prepare and start trying to incorporate surveillance into our mindframe and ruleset for the information age.

The longer we ignore it, the more likely we are to bump into institutions like the NSA for which we have no legal precedent, nor do we have adequate understanding.

And by the way, since most states recognize gay marriage as legal 'by popular acclaim', you're wrong with or without your misrepresentation of historical fact.

You REALLY think that congress can just spontaneously wake up and recognize an injustice and rectify it of their own accord?  Because congress, i.e. politicians are that aware and enlightened?  What world do you live in?

Cutting education for tax cuts is not something I support they do, cutting regulations for mercury pollution is not something i support they do, cutting minimum wage is not some thing I support they do, cutting overtime rules is not something I can support they do. These aren't hyperboles they are real reasons. ",,0,0,t1_cqvcg7w

For example, a majority of people of a certain religion could pass a law saying any other religion is banned.  That is tyranny of the majority.  This is not allowed due to the Constitution.

But to say that morality can't be in laws is ridiculous, many (most) laws have a basis in morality.  Where that morality comes from is not relevant.  Sorry but it isn't.  I don't know you, don't know your views on religion, ethics, etc.  However, if by chance (and again I don't know if this is the case) you are one of the atheist progressives on this site (of which there are many) then I have to break it to you, 73% of Americans identify as Christians.  You don't get to enforce your views on the rest of the country. 

I absolutely respect your right to worship (or not) as you please.  Morality however is part of the law, whether you like it or not, and always has been.  If you don't like the fact that a lot of this morality has as its basis a Judeo-Christian history, well, too bad.  This is democracy.

&gt; Schottel got another unpleasant surprise when he sought the use-of-force history of the officers involved. He learned that before a new chief took over in 2010 the department had a surprising protocol for non-fatal use-of-force reports.

&gt; “The officer himself could complete it and give it to the supervisor for his approval,” the prior chief, Thomas Moonier, testified in a deposition. “I would read it. It would be placed in my out basket, and my secretary would probably take it and put it with the case file.”

&gt; No copy was made for the officer’s personnel file.

OK, what's next?

&gt; if the cops in baltimore say that freddie gray attacked them in the truck it should be just as credible as Michael brown's friends testimony's that Wilson executed him right?

Well, they didn't say that. Saying it now would be pretty suspicious, and I'd want six cops to have a pretty good reason they couldn't subdue a single guy in handcuffs with non-lethal force.

Let's move on to:

&gt; also there was an eye witness testimony against brown.... the man who testifieds body was found shot and charred in the trunk of a burnt out car in Ferguson during the protests. Disgusting.

Conspiracy theory bullshit.

http://www.snopes.com/politics/crime/deandrejoshua.asp

&gt; However, there is no documentation Deandre Joshua testified before the grand jury. According to the Boston Globe, names of the witnesses were kept secret, and anyone who disclosed that information would face a misdemeanor charge. Additionally, Joshua's family and friends told the New York Times he was nowhere near the scene when Mike Brown was shot and killed, and prosecutors confirmed he was not a grand jury witness.",,0,0,t1_cqvf0ke

No, they're misrepresenting it.

As far as I can tell from reading the bill and the [relevant portion of USC](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/3111), it's only 6.7% of any one person's income. It just includes different clauses to capture different types of classifications of how people are employed.

There are 4 sections on the 6.7% excise tax. 2 apply in general; 1 for employers, and 1 for the self-employed. The other two are from a section on comparable taxes for railroad services, and include a 6.7% excise tax for employers, and a 6.7% excise tax on the compensation of ""employee representatives"", which is a [specific thing relating to some union reps in the railroad industry](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/20/205.2).",,0,0,t1_cqva5nj

No, that is like blaming cold medicine for making you tired.

The fed managed that problem, the fed actions themselves were not the cause.

Reagan chose peace through strength and there is no debate that finishing the cold war opened up the world to economic growth of the 1990s, it was a massive peace dividend.

He slashes taxes which saw millionaires grow by leaps and bounds.

He re-balanced the over-regulation of the LBJ, Nixon, Carter admins.  This reduced barriers for many entrepreneurs to build businesses.

This is middle school level logic right now, how can you not understand that just because a city is bad does not mean the entire city is inherently bad on every possible metric. Yes Baltimore has many issues related to governance that has created problems but you have to be deluded to deny that Baltimore has the capacity to be a good city. It has actually buildings, hospitals, infrastructure, public transportation, and schools that allow a long term upward mobility in area by empowering people at the youngest level (hint:education is still one of the best ways to increase earning power). So why do these issues persist? Because the City is mismanaged (this is the third and last time I have to explain that one part of this city is fucking up, not that everything is fucked up like in a poor 3rd world country).

OK I think I see your point. I think you are claiming that the market value of labor is the only relevant thing and that without minimum wage the market would pay less.

I cannot provide data about paying less than minimum wage.

It's still higher.  How does that change my point?  

&gt;the aggregate average quality of America's post-secondary education isn't better. It's not.

Saying ""it's not"" is not proof.  In fact, it's flat out wrong.  [Source](http://one-europe.info/why-are-european-universities-lagging-behind-american-ones). American universities are superior, on average, to any other country's.  

&gt;But unless there is more than a small marginal increase in the quality of education, your argument is DRASTICALLY counterbalanced by the extremely high cost of education here and our overwhelming levels of student debt.

You know, student debt really only significantly affects those who choose bullshit art, psych, or sociology degrees.  I think the federal government should drastically limit the number of people we loan to for those degrees.  We need to be promoting in-demand skills. If someone wants to take out private loans for a degree like that, more power to them.  All it takes is someone willing to make the loan and someone willing to accept the responsibility that comes with it.

&gt;it seems you lean ""American Libertarian""

Nah, I'm a liberal centrist.  

&gt;you probably argue that it's the subsidies for loans that are driving up the prices.

That has something to do with it, but the bigger causes are athletics and public funding cuts.  

&gt;That's why controlling supply AND pricing for education is the best model and why it's worked so well around the world for producing educated people who can enter the workforce without debt

Except it isn't, because ours are better.  I go to a public university on the east coast and we have a huge number of international students.  And they all say the same thing.  Our schools are vastly superior to their schools in UAE, China, or Germany.  Those are all real examples of people I've met saying that.    

&gt;And yeah, central planning is especially well suited to macro problems like this.

I know very few cases where central planning is superior to market forces.  In fact, I know none.  Market failures are a reality, of course, but they can be doctored without going to a command system.  

&gt;And even beyond these more specific arguments, the reality is that a nation's aggregated tax rate has NO correlation to economic growth.

Conventional economics disagrees with you.  I would love to see a source beyond just your statements.  

&gt;A huge percentage of the population has $10k in net worth or less (40% plus)

You're almost certainly wrong about that.  The median net worth of an American is about 60k.  [Source](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/business/the-typical-household-now-worth-a-third-less.html?_r=0)

&gt;Worse still, EITC perpetuates the moralist's argument that one must labor to earn one's keep.

Do you think you shouldn't have to work, if you can?  I mean, you're more than able to, but you shouldn't expect everyone to pay for you.  

&gt;People would likely experience more utility having free time to choose their endeavors than they would working at ""bullshit jobs""

Kids [read:leftists] say this.  There are no bullshit jobs, beyond a small few that are kept alive artificially by public unions.  No private employer is paying you if they don't need you.  I know, no one likes doing some jobs, but they are still necessary and people are more than capable of turning them down if they think they are worth more.  

&gt;People are not rational actors

I disagree in almost all circumstances.  Don't have so much contempt for others.  

&gt;any expression of preferences based on imperfect information will not be an expression of preference at all

That's why we have laws against fraud and against faulty advertising.  People still make mistakes, but that doesn't mean it isn't their fault to an extent.  

&gt;you may well get a net consumer deficit instead of a consumer surplus that is supposed to occur from trade

Why are leftists so opposed to self responsibility?  They act like everyone is children and need a central authority to make decisions for them.  I'm a liberal man, but I recognize the power of the market and understand that it is far more efficient than any sort of planned economy.  I am pretty much against paternalism in domestic economic matters because it has rarely led to superior outcomes.

Add to that Jeb Bush (please no), a Spanish-speaking former governor with a Mexican-born wife; and Rand Paul, a senator who has made appealing to black voters a central part of his political identity.

At its highest levels, the Republican Party is building a noticeably more diverse group of talent—call it the GOP’s Rainbow Coalition.

This didn’t happen by accident. While the Republican Party’s minority-outreach programs have been mocked in years past—often since they were so at odds with GOP policies that alienated black and Hispanic voters—in the wake of 2012 drubbing at the hands of Barack Obama, the party began a concerted effort to aggressively recruit black and Hispanic candidates. 

Today, the Republicans can call upon an array of minority senators, governors, and congressmen. Black Sen. Tim Scott was elected to fill out Jim DeMint’s Senate term. Black Republican members-elect include Mia Love of Utah and Will Hurd of Texas. Minority governors Susana Martinez, Nikki Haley, and Brian Sandoval all won reelection. Along with Louisiana Gov.

If you wanna talk about Syria, then yeah. I don't know exactly why he wanted to go there. Probably some perverse reasoning that had to do with eliminating an enemy of Israel and generally keeping the region unstable. So fuck McCain for that.

But to just say that he wanted to bomb/invade to resolve every international crisis I think is a bit of a simplistic interpretation of his views.

The nature of nuclear power is to cause its damage in isolated, catastrophic incidents. Unlike most other power generation techniques that just have a constant low level harm that fades into the background.

Its not a situation insurers are particularly prepared to deal with. The harm is too large, and on too long of a time scale, to adequately plan for. Its like trying to purchase Yellowstone Volcano insurance. Just not going to happen.

The mistake he, and many other people make, is to focus purely on the nature of its failure modes. They ignore the other component, per unit of power produced.

I don't care if they are a Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, Independent, Anarchist, Socialist, Federalist, Green... it really doesn't make shit of a difference to me--- doubly so for politicians from the Republicans and Democrats.

I care about issues, not party.  I am also a realist, unlike most people on Reddit, and recognize that it is literally impossible to have the ""perfect candidate"".  So I agree with a lot of stuff Rand Paul has voted for and I disagree with some of it and I agree with a lot of stuff Bernie Sanders has voted for and disagree with some of it.  I don't think Rand Paul will turn the USA into some sort of Libertarian Wild West and I don't think Bernie Sanders will turn the USA into some sort of socialist experiment.

So no, Rand Paul isn't a perfect candidate nor is he identical to Bernie Sanders and I don't care if he is a ""tea partier"".  Bernie Sanders isn't perfect either and he has about as much electability as Rand's father Ron Paul but that doesn't mean I don't support him.

Wouldn't you rather live in a world where the Presidential Election was between Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders and the topics of debate were privacy, role of government, tax plan, domestic and foreign policy?

The fact that the sun goes down, and the wind stops blowing, with alarming frequency. Without a grid scale storage technology, these drawbacks are gamebreakers. How cheap it is under idealized or average conditions is mostly irrelevant, because we don't need average power, we need power 24/7.

Until that exists, we need backup power generation. And we don't want to use fossil fuels. So that means nuclear. And if you're building nuclear to back up the solar and wind, you may as well just run the nuclear plant and skip most of the solar and wind, because nuclear costs pretty much the same whether you run it or not.

Did he? Or was it because of excitement was at record levels and his voter turnout machine was unprecedented?

&gt; as long as we don't have financial control over putting our representatives in power, the threat of schism is the only means of control we have.

The problem is that we're holding a gun to *our own heads* trying to convince them not to abandon us. The ""threat"" here is far far more damaging to ourselves.

What you're missing is a clear rational understanding of the power dynamics at play. If we threaten the Dems losing power by breaking off to the far left, they are not going to come after us, they will abandon us and move further to the right as this is the most rational choice for them to maximize their own power. It is an inevitable consequence of the voting system. It is plainly irrational to hold that gun to your head and threaten yourself with it, as the expected behavior is for them to move to the right no matter what you do. Not voting for the Dems has *worse expected outcomes in all cases*. If somehow you feel deep down that if we all just threatened to pull the trigger that they will come around, I would love to play poker with you cause I found myself a sucker.

I don't think the supporters of welfare intend to abuse it.  However, abuse happens. And you're 100% correct: abuse is gonna happen no matter what. And we can't stop that. People can talk up drug testing or whatever, but that won't stop the abuse.  When people become dependent on welfare and don't want to live without it, they are part of the problem.  The change I mean can be explained by an example, my parents. Two kids when they were 20, my dad working full time and in school, yet they couldn't make ends meet just quite. So they got food stamps. And eventually, made enough so they didn't need them, even though they qualified. But they didn't abuse that option. Which I think is the right thing to do.

And I didn't mean to pass that up! I'm absolutely against breaks for corporations! I don't think tax breaks should be given for anyone. A tax system is designed so that everyone pays in, everyone should benefit. In my opinion at least. Why should rich people or businesses get a cut while middle class or poverished people don't?

You can pretty much track the double-dip recession and the recovery back then by the Fed's interest rate changes. It wasn't Regan.

Recessions don't start on a dime, policies years out cause them.  For example Clinton's community re-investment act forced banks to expand lending rules which opened the door for banks to run amok.

Here is the truth about Carter, Volcker and Reagan: http://www.forbes.com/sites/briandomitrovic/2011/02/07/volcker-and-the-reagan-legacy/

&gt;And the deficit has actually gone DOWN under Obama from where it was at under GWB's final budget.
Meanwhile, under Regan, the deficit ballooned. Obama has been far more fiscally ""conservative"".

DEBT as a % of GDP under Reagan was HALF of what Barry has it at.

Additionally - funny obama taking credit for reducing spending when he shut down the govt trying to fight sequestration....which actually had an effect on spending and deficits.

You need to understand the difference between deficit and total debt.  Deficit is for the year, total debt is the accumulation of yearly deficits.

Context matters - Reagan increase spending relative to the size of the economy 50% of GDP 

From Politifact:

&gt;Obama said since taking office the country has seen ""our deficits cut by two-thirds.""

His claim is accurate if you use 2009, his first year in office with an historically high deficit, as a starting point.

The claim ignores a stark reality about the deficits, however. The country’s spending is not expected to continue its downward route, according to federal forecasters, for factors that include increased interest payments on the debt and the lack of substantial policy changes for the country’s biggest programs, like Social Security and Medicare.

The deficits have largely come down as a result of the improved economy for which Obama cannot assume full credit.

The primary elections depends to which state you're a resident. Different states have different primary voting dates, as well as Party specific or open voting rules. 
You can change your party affiliation by registering, but might not matter..
But guy, try to get a little more info on whomever you support. Check out different issues that are important to you and the country; bonus points if you understand multiple views..
Don't have to geek out completely if it I'll hold you back from getting involved. One vote can seem useless and probably a good chance not gonna be a winning vote. But the participation alone in this whole Democracy thing, is really the whole idea.
For the 411 on all this mess, I'd start by checking out Crash Course YouTube channels. Like http://youtu.be/lrk4oY7UxpQ

Btw, I geeked out at 18yo just to get involved and vote like I was gonna save our country blah blah. But at the end of the day, if you vote or not whatever, if you don't keep informed of what your governments doing, no bitching aloud;)
Ps. Elections are a huge game, although an important reality. Don't get bogged down by all the BS and end up like an old stubborn dude never understanding the other side. Simply be skeptical as f$&amp;@ until you decide. All you gotta do after that is show up get in line walk in to  booth press some buttons and hope. Watch the news after see how shit went down..

I'm 100% positive that the driver and his cop buddies thought it was hilarious to drive as erratically as possible. They would slam on the brakes, whip the van around turns, and do the NASCAR warming up the tires thing. 

Now I'll admit I was drunk, and with my hands cuffed behind my back, I couldn't hold on to anything to keep myself planted. It only took my head/shoulders bouncing off the sides/front portion of the divider a couple of times before I jumped my cuffs so I could hold onto something. There were no windows, so there was absolutely no frame of reference for me to be like ""ok, they're turning left.""

So the van had stopped and I wasn't thinking clearly (again, drunk and very angry that these asswipes were doing this shit on purpose)  and before I realized I should put my cuffed hands behind my back, they opened the rear door laughing their asses off. That is until they saw my hands in front of me; that earned quite a few elbows and punches while they re-cuffed me.

Someone saves your ass on a bust once.  And in a few years down the line you catch them doing something if not actually illegal but shady, because honestly most people don't just drop straight to villian, and you report them for it the other cops are going to think they can't trust you because so much of that job is a judgement call.

Even in my own work which I do not weild anywhere near the level of power a cop does I attempt to cover screw ups of my co workers so they don't end up fired.  It's because I think everyone has a bad days or makes iffy judgement calls.  

However the police are given such power over us and need a good deal of it to mantain law and order, but, and forgive my nerdy reference, much like being a Paladin the second they violate policy with out a dire urgent need, IE you didnt buckle in a suspect in your car due to shots being fired on you, when they step out of it they should be stripped of all the power and protection it provides.

The Christians will act in a certain way, only because they hear its satanists, they will get very angry and defensive and will lash out, and this will probably result in them trying to make laws even stricter or be more aggressiv against girls and the women that try to get abortion, maybe even group them together with the satanists as this big ""evil"" group, and that their reaction probably won't have that many effects on the satanists themselfs.

He is not against getting rid of these laws, he thinks that the way they are doing it, is suboptimal since it will lead to this anger in christians that, no matter if you aggree or disaggree with it, will happen.

He thinks trying to get these laws to go away without using the ""satanist card"" would be better, because it would lead to less backlash that will hit those poor girls and women!

I hope you understand now?

Forget the power corporate lobbying will have on her administration, her bellicose foreign policy, the fact that she's more to the right of Obama who has already scaled up drone attacks and mass surveillance -- think of the Court! The institutional and social change we need will not come from the Supreme Court which is inherently reactionary anyway:

""But really, the Supreme Court is a fundamentally reactionary tool of bourgeois power. Liberal opinion still seems to think that the Warren court was something other than a 15-year anomaly in its mostly awful history.

Why this boring and annoying obsession with The Court? Is it because liberals think that the people are fundamentally dolts, and turn to unelected judges to accomplish what democratic agitation can’t? This seems to be the strategy of the reproductive rights movement, which does little but litigate and lobby while access to abortion dwindles, and popular opinion moves in unpleasant directions. And the labor movement looks to have been doing similar things: when you can’t organize, file suits. But for most of American history, judges have done the work of elites—which isn’t surprising, given their social origins and professional training.

Give up on the courts. They’re hopeless.""",,0,0,t1_cqacil2
